2018-03-08 22:15:35	fschuindt	Folks, I've implemented the same math formula in C and in Elixir. The Elixir version returns 21.000000000000004, the C one returns 23.478714. I've elaborated here: https://gist.github.com/fschuindt/edc3369c16a741e2253acff1ad2d8cad I'm probably making something stupid. Any tip is welcome, cheers!
2018-03-08 22:17:50	eyepatch	How do I determine which version of the standard library is being used for linking?
2018-03-08 22:18:19	eyepatch	##c++ helped me figure out that the issue was that I was linking to an old std library with a new version of lang.
2018-03-08 22:23:27	eyepatch	fschuindt: A quick calculation in Python suggests that the answer should be 23.4787....
2018-03-08 22:24:34	eyepatch	I don't know Elixir, but I noticed that in your C code, your types and literals are all over the place. You're using integers in some places, doubles in other, etc. Is it possible that you're doing integer arithmetic in Elixir somewhere?
2018-03-08 22:26:31	fschuindt	eyepatch: I'm not quite sure. Elixir is suposed to handle the types for me. I'm doing a hand calculation right now.
2018-03-08 22:26:54	eyepatch	(x_of(n) - y_of(n)) / @golden_n
2018-03-08 22:26:57	fschuindt	When you say "all over the place", isn't suposed to be that way? Sorry, I'm learning C, this is my first program.
2018-03-08 22:26:57	eyepatch	This looks suspect
2018-03-08 22:27:24	fschuindt	why?
2018-03-08 22:27:26	eyepatch	In C, you have "return (XOf(n) - YOf(n)) / 2;"
2018-03-08 22:27:49	fschuindt	yes
2018-03-08 22:27:58	fschuindt	isn't the same thing?
2018-03-08 22:28:01	eyepatch	That first calculation is simply labeled of, but if it's supposed to be "fib of" you're simply using two different calculations.
2018-03-08 22:28:07	eyepatch	golden_n != 2
2018-03-08 22:28:46	fschuindt	I'm kinda confused :/
2018-03-08 22:28:47	eyepatch	I don't know what the correct answer should be, but try substituting (XOf(n) - YOf(n)) / GOLDEN_N; in FibOf
2018-03-08 22:29:08	fschuindt	or
2018-03-08 22:29:09	fschuindt	man
2018-03-08 22:29:11	fschuindt	I got it
2018-03-08 22:29:21	fschuindt	thanks very much eyepatch 
2018-03-08 22:29:33	eyepatch	In one language, you're dividing by 2. In another, you're dividing by 2.236. I'm not surprised if you're getting different results.
2018-03-08 22:30:13	fschuindt	yes, me too. haha, I knew it was something stupid
2018-03-08 22:31:44	eyepatch	Re: types, Take a look at "return powl((numerator / 2), n);"
2018-03-08 22:32:16	eyepatch	Here, you're taking a double, dividing it by an integer, and then using it in a function that takes a long double with another integer, then casting the result to a long double for the return.
2018-03-08 22:32:47	eyepatch	I'm not sure if I got that right either, so I usually try to avoid mixing types like that this much.
2018-03-08 22:34:09	fschuindt	I understand, I will improve this. I'm just starting my journey in C. And thank you again. Really helpful.
2018-03-08 22:34:25	fschuindt	And about the correct formula: https://fschuindt.github.io/blog/2017/09/21/concurrent-calculation-of-fibonacci-in-elixir.html
2018-03-08 22:34:57	fschuindt	This is a post by me. It's suposed to divide by sqrt(5) (aka golden_n), not by 2.
2018-03-08 22:35:13	fschuindt	And the awnser is 21, becuase is the 8th Fibonacci term position
2018-03-08 22:38:35	eyepatch	https://pastebin.com/n58Vxfbr
2018-03-08 22:39:14	eyepatch	I've changed the types and made the implicit return cast explicit here. I don't usually use a long double type, usually doubles are plenty precise for me, but I thought I'd keep with your convention.
2018-03-08 22:40:13	eyepatch	https://pastebin.com/877xM4Vy
2018-03-08 22:40:18	eyepatch	Here's a version that uses doubles
2018-03-08 22:41:05	eyepatch	Oops. I used <cmath> (which is a C++) thing. I meant to use <math.h>. You may need to fix other C++-isms.
2018-03-08 22:41:23	fschuindt	eyepatch: Sir, you're amazing. Thank you again. I will implement your way, or if you want: https://github.com/fschuindt/cfib feel free to do it yourself (for proper credits)
