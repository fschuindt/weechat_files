What would be the simplest way to get that interface without calling crda? Whenever I load the cfg80211 module using modprobe, it complains about not finding crda binary (which is true, there isn't one I've compiled due to too many dependencies)...
2018-03-01 12:42:13	tdtrask	JeanScotch: other reference to keep in mind is https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/ACF_core_principles - Play around with creating a CFE with the various types to see how they display on a web page.

2018-03-01 15:27:16	duncan^	That sounds like a captive portal
2018-03-01 15:27:49	duncan^	What happens is: you get the DHCP lease via WiFi, but the hostpot restricts you from doing much until you agree to the T&Cs
2018-03-01 15:27:56	duncan^	the logic is on the hotspot
2018-03-01 15:28:22	scv	right
2018-03-01 15:28:49	scv	typically the hotspot will either assign itself as the dns server or perform hijacking (can be problematic)
2018-03-01 15:28:55	scv	and redirect your initial requests to itself

2018-03-02 10:56:27	bernhardgruen[m]	seems so. One thing I could remotely imagine is that it runs before network is there.
2018-03-02 10:59:08	bernhardgruen[m]	I assume that you already have some other values in 00-alpine.conf. You could for example set 'kernel.panic=123' (normally 120) and see if this value is set correctly after reboot.

2018-03-02 15:54:29	bernhardgruen[m]	idint: At least there is an easy workaround: load the module ipv6 in either /etc/modules or /etc/modules-load.d/*.conf
2018-03-02 15:55:30	idint	wew i thought it is loaded automatically, i was trying rc_need with "modules" as well and that's why it wasn't oading

2018-03-02 15:55:35	TBB	openrc also acts a bit weird wrt service dependencies; "before" and "after" don't quite work the way you'd suppose them to
2018-03-02 15:55:59	bernhardgruen[m]	I am not sure if this can also be seen as resolution of the ticket (#8599).
2018-03-02 15:56:56	bernhardgruen[m]	I don't know which start script at the end is responsible for loading the ipv6 module. But this way it works for me.

2018-03-02 19:23:18	mps	it is from  ncurses-terminfo package
2018-03-02 19:24:28	Aerdan[m]	okay, I'd suggest filing a bug with neovim
2018-03-02 19:26:37	mps	well, I thought so, but I had another crash with tmux in st, but cannot reproduce it
2018-03-02 19:27:30	mps	some combo of the random Ctrl- keys, which I forgot

2018-03-02 19:28:34	classict	hi, newbie here :-)
2018-03-02 19:29:12	classict	I run this command----->apk add gstreamer1 and get this error-------------->ERROR: unsatisfiable constraints:   gstreamer1 (missing):     required by: world[gstreamer1]
2018-03-02 19:31:22	mps	classict: gstreamer (without 1) maybe?
2018-03-02 19:32:19	classict	yes, it works
2018-03-02 19:32:39	classict	now how I can install packages with wildcard like gst*
2018-03-02 19:32:42	classict	??
2018-03-02 19:33:33	mps	classict: can't remember, but think just like you say: apk add gst*
2018-03-02 19:34:25	classict	doesn't work
2018-03-02 19:34:28	mps	but I prefer to install packages one by one, to not make some unintetional mess
2018-03-02 19:34:59	classict	I search a package, but when I try to installit appear missing error....
2018-03-02 19:35:23	TBB	try piping a search result to xargs
2018-03-02 19:35:32	mps	can't remember, but I think I did once just with "apk add 'pkg*'"
2018-03-02 19:36:42	TBB	apk search something* | xargs apk add
2018-03-02 19:36:44	classict	If i put package without version, it works
2018-03-02 19:36:50	classict	maybe some cache
