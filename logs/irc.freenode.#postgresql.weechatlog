2018-03-15 09:14:31	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. I'm designing a database structre here and came across a dumb relational question. In this diagram here: https://s14.postimg.org/6m803vgj5/Screen_Shot_2018-03-15_at_09.11.12.png The requests table is suposed to have the columns of payer_id and payment_method_id? It's a one to one relation and I'm kinda confused where I'm going to put the references, in the requests or in the orther two
2018-03-15 09:14:31	fschuindt	tables. Any tip? Thank you.

2018-03-15 09:22:03	dataderp	ilmari tried it, unfortunately the trigger runs once per UPDATE... Guess I could overcomplicate it and SELECT the current row as t he final data, and use the first trigger invocation OLD as the original one, but this relies on ordering and seems like the beginning of a foot-gun :P
2018-03-15 09:22:35	fschuindt	escherial: so do you recommend me to keep it the way it is or to add payer_id and payment_method_id to requests?

2018-03-15 09:48:30	escherial	roadie: i recently accidentally upgrade to postgres 10, and i noticed like you that the postgres user doesn't exist by default. if you want to create it, you can use createuser postgres -s (to make a user 'postgres' with superuser privileges)

2018-03-15 10:29:15	harks	I tried to update a chunk of a table that has several GB in size (precisely I tried to null one column)
2018-03-15 10:29:18	XenophonF	longer - it's a varchar(40) right now, and they want it to be a varchar(100)

2018-03-15 10:30:33	XenophonF	He wants to do an `update pg_attribute set atttypmod = 100+4 ...` instead.
2018-03-15 10:30:46	RhodiumToad	XenophonF: that's a really, really bad idea
2018-03-15 10:30:47	harks	This apperently occurs for multiple files (I tried a couple of different chunks by now).
2018-03-15 10:31:13	depesz	RhodiumToad: any idea why slave would be locked on master doing autovacuum to toast table?
2018-03-15 10:31:17	RhodiumToad	harks: have you tried doing a pg_dump of the whole db?
2018-03-15 10:31:19	depesz	and if anything about it can be done?
2018-03-15 10:31:22	XenophonF	That's also what I told him, so I'm glad to hear that I'm right :)
2018-03-15 10:31:30	XenophonF	thanks RhodiumToad
2018-03-15 10:31:38	harks	no, should I?
2018-03-15 10:32:25	harks	it's accutally a development instance, so I can just trash it, and reimport a backup
2018-03-15 10:32:27	RhodiumToad	harks: well, it might show how widespread the corruption is and what kind
2018-03-15 10:32:32	RhodiumToad	harks: oh

2018-03-15 10:33:25	depesz	all are waiting for lock on "table"
2018-03-15 10:33:44	harks	But I am interested in what caused the corruption. If it's hardware related reimporting probably won't do any good.

2018-03-15 10:35:40	depesz	if it's access exclusive?
2018-03-15 10:36:00	RhodiumToad	well, normal vacuum has to do access exclusive lock while trying to shorten the table, if it does that
2018-03-15 10:36:09	RhodiumToad	and that lock will propagate to the slave

2018-03-15 14:23:32	azeem	both depend on the internal structure of your data and cannot be figured out by looking at the files in PGDATA

2018-03-15 15:57:11	dataderp	Zr40 yeah it was indeed plv8, which could use an option to keep timestamps as string. peerce plv8 has its flaws obviously, it is after all javascript... but it is also an amazing pain reliever for other things

2018-03-15 19:55:19	kakashiAL	so if its not possible in PG, it means that PG by design let you wait after the transmission is commited?
2018-03-15 19:55:21	peerce	if you're going to read the same data several times in a tarnsaction, use SELECT FOR UDPATE to lock it.

2018-03-15 20:17:16	dataderp	sure, "not public" is what i phrased as "in the future", while other transactions only read the present
2018-03-15 20:17:24	kakashiAL	ningu: another question is: why does PG not give you two options only: WAIT or REJECT because other transaction is still working?

2018-03-15 20:19:35	kakashiAL	ningu: you have two concurrent transactions, working on the same row. Why not do this by design: first transaction wins, second transaction must WAIT or will be REJECTED and let it know 'hey, there is a transaction that does some work, so try again later'

2018-03-15 20:26:15	kakashiAL	ningu: hmmm....okay, but that means that we its okayish to live with anomalies just because of performance?
2018-03-15 20:26:25	peerce	easy way to solve your problem, only allow one transaction at a time!
2018-03-15 20:26:26	ningu	kakashiAL: no, it means we have to write good code
2018-03-15 20:26:34	ningu	and use our brains
2018-03-15 20:26:43	peerce	and yes, the entire universe lives with anomalies.
2018-03-15 20:27:09	dataderp	if you don't want anomalies just use serializable transactions, and make sure your code can reattempt any operation as many times as necessary

2018-03-15 22:22:42	daurnimator	lambdawanky: the suggestion might be to not use RDS; but instead use normal EC2 instances.
2018-03-15 22:22:49	LiamW	once you put the money down on servers buying rackspace is trivial compared to what those servers would cost you on AWS

2018-03-15 22:25:20	peerce	i use the terms interchangably for postgres.  cluster means something quite different in general computing, a distributed multi-host system, or an active/standby HA pair, or whatever.

2018-03-15 22:26:34	lluad	Yeah. Strictly inside postgresql they mean the same thing. While "cluster" is the official term I mostly avoid it, as it (now) means something wildly different outside the postgresql world.
2018-03-15 22:26:37	ningu	that is, the instance is the compute resource, cluster is the storage (mor or less)

2018-03-15 22:32:48	ningu	one benefit of RDS and other cloud-based services is you can separate the database cluster (your data) from the hardware it's running on (the instance or instances)
2018-03-15 22:32:57	ningu	so you could start with a low-powered server, then ramp up later. or whatever
2018-03-15 22:33:08	blonkhart	hello, i am creating my first database and have a big many-to-many relationship.  i came across this question about big composite keys v surrogate keys: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2517649/should-i-use-a-huge-composite-primary-key-or-just-a-unique-id
2018-03-15 22:33:12	ningu	I agree with everyone here who says it's too expensive for many situations
2018-03-15 22:33:26	ningu	but, that flexibility is supposed to be one of the selling points
2018-03-15 22:33:42	blonkhart	the only answer that makes sense to me is the one with 0 votes at the bottom, recommending that the surrogate key be created from the hash of the composite keys

2018-03-15 22:36:13	blonkhart	thanks ningu
2018-03-15 22:36:14	ningu	a surrogate key as serial/bigserial can make it easier to refer to the row with a foreign key

2018-03-15 22:36:26	masterasia	update users set a='b', c='d' if (x or y) else do_nothing(don't set c='d', go ahead with a='b') <-- is that possible?

2018-03-15 22:46:02	dfee	peerce: this is an e-commerce catalog. so by normalization, i mean that a product should have a set of attributes definied by it's "product_type". so no, not truly infinite.
2018-03-15 22:46:26	dfee	i'd imagine a very large number of permutations though.
2018-03-15 22:46:37	LiamW	it sounds like you actually have multiple tables

2018-03-15 22:47:23	LiamW	I mean based on what your data model seems to imply for this table
2018-03-15 22:47:33	dfee	right now i have `product_types`, `products`, `product_attributes`, `product_attribute_values`
2018-03-15 22:47:39	dfee	ah.
2018-03-15 22:47:44	LiamW	trying to affix a schema to a json column is generally a sign that you need to normalize your data into having columns
2018-03-15 22:48:12	LiamW	saying that the schema can be different depending on what the type is implies that your data represents what would belong in multiple tables when normalized
2018-03-15 22:48:21	LiamW	make sense?

2018-03-15 22:49:39	ningu	yes, json is generally for cases where you don't want normalization or (more justifiably) there is no feasible way to do it at all because the data comes from unpredictable/complex sources
2018-03-15 22:50:21	dfee	it does blow this up from a problem of managing my current 4 tables, to a problem of managing N tables. which isn't so bad, except that I'm now possibly making my application layer harder to reason about
2018-03-15 22:50:27	peerce	i would think the products table would have like product_id, product_name, product_type, product_attributes jsonb
2018-03-15 22:50:29	ningu	if you actually have well-defined schemas and want to enforce them, I'd break them down into tables. you can have one generic table for things they all share, possibly, with additional tables for each schema
2018-03-15 22:50:34	peerce	and any other product specific data
2018-03-15 22:50:48	peerce	so you ONLY put the type specific attributes in the jsonb field.
2018-03-15 22:50:55	ningu	hmm... yes, that could work too
2018-03-15 22:51:08	ningu	but then you can't enforce the structure of the jsonb field (could be good or bad)

2018-03-15 22:58:39	dfee	ok, so back to the EAV challenge. i expect "product type" to define the attributes. so the product type "bicycle" might have attributes "wheel size", "frame material", and "automobile" might have "engine type", "miles per gallon", "warranty" (not required). it's up to the product then "Volkswagen Jetta" to have engine_type and mpg, and optionally warranty.

2018-03-16 01:02:01	Bytecoin	If somebody wanted to take the "logic" of PostgreSQL and make it work "embedded", for use as a single-user desktop application, how much work would that take? I think I've heard before that not only is PostgreSQL service/daemon-based, but it'd be very hard or impossible to allow it to be embedded. Is this true?
2018-03-16 01:02:43	Bytecoin	I don't like the idea of software that has "inner" installers for PostgreSQL (for example) which is then to run in the usual way on the system.

2018-03-16 05:27:16	nickb	I was trying to do a cheap trick and run `create index` statements in parallel using pg_restore. Since I had the schema with data present (but indexes dropped) I created a dummy schema, then run: 'alter database set search_path=dummy;' pg_dump -Fd -j 4;
2018-03-16 05:28:05	nickb	so when after I did `alter database set search_path=non_dummy` and run pg_restore it still ran against old schema :)
2018-03-16 05:28:14	RhodiumToad	of course it did
2018-03-16 05:28:35	nickb	oh..
2018-03-16 05:28:39	RhodiumToad	restore is supposed to restore what you dumped, so it ignores any search path settings
2018-03-16 05:28:40	nickb	it sets search_path explicitly
2018-03-16 05:28:50	nickb	I'm just blind
2018-03-16 05:29:02	RhodiumToad	in fact since the latest security patches, it schema-qualifies everything as well
2018-03-16 05:29:11	nickb	I'm on 10.2 :)
2018-03-16 05:29:38	RhodiumToad	you could have created a new db
2018-03-16 05:29:45	RhodiumToad	then created your schema in that
2018-03-16 05:29:58	nickb	good point

2018-03-16 05:31:12	--	lecx_ is now known as lecx
2018-03-16 05:32:34	nickb	I had another question. Was lurking around sequence.c and it seems fairly easy to add a two-argument nextval(); (where second argument is custom increment value). Would it make sense to just add the 2nd argument  to nextval_internal and replace all calls to it with nextval(..., 0); and if the increment argument is 0 then use increment from sequence otherwise provided one.
2018-03-16 05:34:26	peerce	seauences are only meant to produce unique ascending values, nothing less, nothing more.

2018-03-16 05:36:41	nickb	but thats not the point. I want to add a nextval function with two arguments: nextval('myseq', 100); that would increment sequence by 100 and allow me to use 100 consecutive values without worrying that concurrent sessions could use it

2018-03-16 05:38:12	peerce	concurrent sessions get their own nextvals, they never overlap, so I fail to see what this does useful?
2018-03-16 05:38:27	RhodiumToad	nickb: but shouldn;t nextval(x,100) respect the sequence increment, and be effectively the same as calling nextval 100 times with no intervening ops?
2018-03-16 05:38:52	RhodiumToad	peerce: this is to batch allocate a set of values in advance, which isn't that unusual a requirement
2018-03-16 05:38:53	nickb	RhodiumToad: I was thinking about it for a while. I think it should not
2018-03-16 05:39:19	RhodiumToad	nickb: seems pretty clear to me that it should
2018-03-16 05:39:41	RhodiumToad	nickb: possibly also nextval(x,100) might usefully return 3 values: first,last,increment
2018-03-16 05:40:03	nickb	RhodiumToad: My chain of thought was the following: if the pilot wants to increment by X then its pilots responsibility to define X.
2018-03-16 05:41:05	nickb	RhodiumToad: but I've never used increment in production and have no idea what are the implications
2018-03-16 05:42:03	RhodiumToad	I've used it
2018-03-16 05:42:04	nickb	RhodiumToad: if we look at it from another perspective: cache doesn't care about increment. Cache 100 gives you exactly 100 not 100*increment
2018-03-16 05:42:25	RhodiumToad	hmm?
2018-03-16 05:42:26	nickb	RhodiumToad: could you describe the context?

2018-03-16 07:21:22	rudi_s	Hi. I have a few questions about the recent search path issue (CVE-2018-1058). Where can I find information about the default permissions of PUBLIC? https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-grant.html says per default no permissions are granted on schemas, but that's not true for the public schema, which is writable by PUBLIC.

2018-03-16 07:23:20	rudi_s	And I'm confused about the permissions of new schemas. When I run CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION user; then \dn+ in psql shows an empty "Access privileges" but it looks like PUBLIC has no access to that scheme. However when I run REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA user FROM PUBLIC "Access privilieges" now lists only the user - however the output of pg_dump stays the same. Where is this access change stored?

2018-03-16 07:24:49	rudi_s	And it feels like the fix for CVE-2018-1058 as mentioned on the wiki, move everything out of the public schema (or adapt the search path for all users) makes working with the database more tedious as I can't just use \d to see all tables and instead must use \dn to find the schemas and then \dt schema. - how are you handling these extra steps?

2018-03-16 08:14:50	rb04a	morning all, I have a table, users, with the schema id (varchar - uniq pk), jdoc (jsonb). My table has ~12 million rows. I need to export to a csv file a subset of the keys in my jdocs. The implementation does a copy of the id column to a text file (so it's an index only query), and then in chunks of 2500 I run the query to actually build the csv, using a where condition on the `id` column... My question is, short of
2018-03-16 08:14:51	rb04a	adding an index for my query, how can I improve the performance of this export? Would a smaller batch size help?
2018-03-16 08:15:33	rb04a	the script at the moment just loops through my batches and uses `psql` to do a \copy to my csv file. would `pg_dump` be quicker?

2018-03-16 08:33:27	Myon	you have the problem that your IDs are in index order, but the rows are probably stored in a totally different order
2018-03-16 08:33:55	Myon	so instead of reading the table sequentially, each of your batches reads a huge random sample of pages for the users table
2018-03-16 08:34:20	rb04a	ah so eventually I will hit a batch that must page many times, makes sense

2018-03-16 16:11:19	alankila	still, it won't be totally ideal. In reality you need some kind of schema at some point. If the database doesn't know what it is, then your program does, and hopefully explicitly

2018-03-16 16:34:59	dataderp	dfee I think the json schema being the source of truth is a valid and flexible approach, but from experience unless you have thousands of possible attributes (and even then maybe), modelling things properly in the db makes it immensely easier to do maintenance and avoid inconsistencies over time
2018-03-16 16:36:03	dataderp	everytime I enforced my schema outside of the db, I eventually ended up spending a lot of time writing consistency checking jobs, and fixing corrupted data (and having to deal with annoyed clients)
2018-03-16 16:36:14	dfee	dataderp: that's the trouble. i 100% agree with your sentiment. i just don't know how to do database modeling when i don't know the right schema from day 1.
2018-03-16 16:37:08	dataderp	any reason you need to do modeling before knowing the schema?

2018-03-16 16:37:24	dfee	dataderp: and then on top of that, there is the question of what structure should i use to put those attributes into the table? should i use composition? just an indefinitely big table?

2018-03-16 16:38:43	dataderp	well, what I did that worked fairly well in a previous project, was to create many tables, each with 50 columns, each holding a specific attribute

2018-03-16 16:39:21	dataderp	to add an attribute, you could do a simple alter table add column, and if you reached 50, then you'd need to create a new table, and add it to the master view definition
2018-03-16 16:39:48	dataderp	didn't even make a tool for it, just had a template to recreate the view

2018-03-16 16:43:53	peerce	then fix the ap so its OLAP (big/slow) queries are either made against a 2nd db server thats a replica of the first, or use a seperate small connection pool so only a couple OLAP queries can be made at once, and the rest queue
2018-03-16 16:44:18	adlaistevenson	Yes, I will fix the app so it doesn't generate that exact slow query again, but due to the fact the queries are dynamically generated (and there are so many different places in the code with them), I need a fallback.
2018-03-16 16:44:26	dataderp	are those queries selects or updates?

2018-05-26 23:07:52	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. I'm trying to produce the following query: https://gist.github.com/fschuindt/1da4edc93d26b1c86f489bcfda4d8bce I think that LAG functions may help me, but I'm kinda lost. Any clue? Thank you.
2018-05-26 23:08:57	RhodiumToad	vyadha: the box and <@ builtin operators are for euclidean geometry, that's fine as long as you understand the limitations
2018-05-26 23:09:28	RhodiumToad	vyadha: for GIS work beyond the most trivial things, you likely want to use postgis

2018-05-27 00:38:24	AndroidToad	vyadha: the braces are the least of it
