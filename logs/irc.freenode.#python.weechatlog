2018-08-16 16:51:15	jmgb4	SnoopJeDi, I dont know how to better explain it to you but thats alright. Ill just work on seeing if I can reassemble everything correctly.

2018-08-16 17:30:12	SnoopJeDi	OO-Dragon, the simplest answer is to begin looking at libraries you're already familiar with. You might even find stuff to help with.
2018-08-16 17:30:18	jmgb4	SnoopJeDi, Alright looking at your example what you told me to do with line 14. I am not actually multiplying the numbers by which row they are on. Its way more complex than that. Right now I am just looking to be able to just be able to get this into an array correctly.
2018-08-16 17:30:22	dimino	you'd do like "calc = BackoffCalculator(datetime.datetime.now())" and then you could do "calc.next()" and it'd give you the next time to retry

2018-08-16 18:52:31	jfhbrook	pycoderf, imo there isn't a concept of classes being "overpowered", like you don't go into a project all, oh I'm writing a small script so I'm not using classes, or the inverse, people don't go oh I'm working on a big project that means I must dogmatically use classes
2018-08-16 18:52:34	Ninpo	But if you have a short script and a couple of functions that do different things, you don't need classes.

2018-08-16 19:01:50	hapax	dumb q: as long as your loops are separated and the loops are sequential, you can reuse the range loop iteration variable "i" right?
2018-08-16 19:02:12	_habnabit	hapax, you can even reuse them in nested loops
2018-08-16 19:02:19	_habnabit	hapax, it makes for confusing code though
2018-08-16 19:02:27	pycoderf	is there some docs or talks i can show him to get him to chill out on it

2018-08-16 19:02:36	hapax	seems bad practice, as 26+ nested loops feel "easily avoidable"

2018-08-16 19:03:00	_habnabit	hapax, i mean like `for x in y: for x in x:` is valid and will "do the right thing"
2018-08-16 19:03:02	hapax	I sometimes do kk, lll, mmmm, etc
2018-08-16 19:03:21	hapax	properly nested execution, sequentially by loop
2018-08-16 19:03:25	hapax	cool thanks
