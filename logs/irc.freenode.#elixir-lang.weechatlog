I get `** (SyntaxError) iex:20: atom cannot be followed by an alias. If the '.' was meant to be part of the atom's name, the atom name must be quoted. Syntax error before: '.'`

2017-02-05 11:32:08	notriddle	Dumb question that's motivated by a compiler error time: why does Elixir use `when` for guard clauses instead of `if`?
2017-02-05 11:32:18	Lerk0	Nicd-: Yes but it's not my websocket I'm trying to connect.
2017-02-05 11:32:33	Nicd-	notriddle: if is used for if
2017-02-05 11:32:44	nox	notriddle: That's what Erlang and other functional languages do.
2017-02-05 11:33:15	nox	notriddle: I was surprised at Rust for reusing 'if'.
2017-02-05 11:33:25	Lerk0	I'm trying (if possible) to somehow mimic Chrome's connection to that websocket because I can see the data flow in the frame table in Chrome.
2017-02-05 11:33:25	notriddle	Makes sense...
2017-02-05 11:33:27	nox	Probably Graydon thought 'when' was too long a keyword. :P

2017-02-06 09:49:00	micmus	sasajuric: that's true, but I feel like I have to do this less often. But the mileage may vary for various people
2017-02-06 09:49:15	sasajuric	I usually start with hexdocs, and then it's easy to look at the code. I hate when some libs don't set links to code in their docs.
2017-02-06 09:49:21	micmus	There's definitely place for more content on elixir
2017-02-06 09:49:57	sasajuric	micmus: yeah not that often, and in fact IIRC I'd usually find that it's spelled out somewhere in docs, but I wouldn't notice it on the first pass

2017-02-06 09:52:06	gazler	The main issue I have with docs is finding where things are defined. This is especially true when functions are defined with metaprogramming.

2017-02-06 09:53:00	micmus	IO.inspect(&imported_fun/3) - prints with module name
2017-02-06 09:53:03	gazler	Actually, I wonder if some sort of first-class solution for configuration would be valuable?
2017-02-06 09:53:18	micmus	you mean in the docs?
2017-02-06 09:53:23	gazler	Yeag.
2017-02-06 09:53:42	gazler	At the moment, it is just littered round the documentation for most projects.
2017-02-06 09:54:15	micmus	true, but I also find that most libraries rely too heavily on the application env for options, instead of just accepting them as arguments
2017-02-06 09:54:25	micmus	possibly with application env for defaults
2017-02-06 09:55:40	gazler	That is true.

2017-02-06 09:57:46	gazler	The first required knowledge is to know that the config is in the Ecto.Repo docs page.
2017-02-06 09:57:52	micmus	maybe we shouldn't making them all flat, and istead have repo accept options under pool: [] and adapter: [] opts
2017-02-06 09:57:55	gazler	Which is where I think having a config page could be useful.

2017-02-06 12:14:20	pmsmith	Matz team is buried in Heroku somewhere, communication and documentation is all Japanese and very isolated. Goals are very modest (Ruby 3x3 in 2020).
2017-02-06 12:14:28	pmsmith	Just look at what Python did only the last 2 years.
2017-02-06 12:14:35	nox	What happens if Guido dies?
2017-02-06 12:14:43	pmsmith	nox: completely nothing
2017-02-06 12:14:49	nox	AFAIK he is still BDFL.
2017-02-06 12:14:57	nox	Proof: still no decent fp in Python. o//
2017-02-06 12:15:16	pmsmith	it doesn't matter, Python steering is very much like Java steering. There's a ton of weight from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and so on.

2017-02-06 12:18:40	smeevil	pmsmith maybe it helps, we have decided to switch from ruby (after 10 years) to elixir about a year ago, and we now only have elixir projects that we work on. the development is very strong and so it the community. also since its based on erlang which has been around for ever, you have a solid foundation and can always fall back to that. There are a lot of ruby developers coming over and I would put all my money on the

2017-02-06 12:20:05	pmsmith	nox: just a vanity metric
2017-02-06 12:20:07	nox	I wonder if José ever thought of doing teams like in Rust land.
2017-02-06 12:20:24	nox	Though Elixir is way smaller.
2017-02-06 12:20:45	pmsmith	nox: well, it's very popular and smart nowadays to form committees in open source projects that are high profile. see React, for example.

2017-02-06 12:21:05	havenwood	pmsmith: I've found it easier to level up junior devs with Elixir and Phoenix due to the simplicity and explicitness of the lang and framework. There's enough of a critical mass behind Elixir at this point that I'd not be too concerned about its longevity.

2017-02-06 17:43:37	smeevil	Hmmm, I'm trying to find where phoenix defines the default MyApp.LayoutView , since I have an umbrella app like Bazaar.Api , my layout view should be Bazaar.Api.LayoutView, but i cannot find where to let phoenix know about this. I thought it was by setting the :namespace option in web.ex like 'use Phoenix.View, root: "web/templates", namespace: Bazaar.Api' but this seems to make no difference

2017-02-06 21:26:06	Radar	hey rpihlak_
2017-02-06 21:26:22	rpihlak_	how can I change conn port in tests using Phoenix?
2017-02-06 21:27:04	Radar	rpihlak_: I think that's configured in config/test.exs. Why would you want to change the port though?

2017-02-06 21:30:09	rpihlak_	I tried changing it in test.exs but it did not have any effect
2017-02-06 21:30:22	rpihlak_	I also tried get %Plug.Conn{conn | port: 1337}, "/"
2017-02-06 21:30:50	rpihlak_	and build_conn(:get, "https://host.com:1337")
2017-02-06 21:31:32	rpihlak_	after passing conn to Phoenix.Router.get the port is reset to 80

2017-02-07 00:28:12	crispin	Hi there everyone. I'm trying to run phoenix in dev mode but WITHOUT code reloading
2017-02-07 00:28:28	crispin	how do I switch off hot code reloading in dev
2017-02-07 00:28:35	crispin	what I really need it to do is NOT watch the js
2017-02-07 00:28:52	crispin	as I save the .js, the phoenix server notices the file has changed and reloads the entire page
2017-02-07 00:29:10	crispin	I'm using clojurescript on the front end with figwheel hot loading, and figwheel gives you in the browser errors
2017-02-07 00:29:12	chrismccord	crispin : do you still want code reload on manual refreshes?
2017-02-07 00:29:26	crispin	yeah. manual refresh can reload
2017-02-07 00:29:38	crispin	its just phoenix is reloading the whole page, and Im losing the figwheel error message
2017-02-07 00:29:42	chrismccord	remove `code_reloader: true` to disable the "refresh driven development"
2017-02-07 00:30:26	crispin	trying...
2017-02-07 00:30:29	chrismccord	crispin : for the live reloading, you can set phoenix_live_reload to not watch js assets
2017-02-07 00:30:55	chrismccord	crispin : for your live_reload patterns in config/dev.exs, just remove priv/static
2017-02-07 00:31:01	crispin	ah sweet beauty!
2017-02-07 00:31:10	crispin	that works a treat chrismccord
2017-02-07 00:31:11	chrismccord	crispin : to be clear, you should leave the `code_relaoder: true` in place
2017-02-07 00:31:28	crispin	ok, will try just removing the js assets
2017-02-07 00:31:30	chrismccord	and you can also leave live reload in place so you get refreshes when things like templates change. Best of all words

2017-02-07 08:14:13	BeerLover	ciawal what exactly?
2017-02-07 08:14:33	ciawal	if you use this: {_pub, privateKey} = :crypto.generate_key(:ecdh, :secp256k1)
2017-02-07 08:14:38	ciawal	then sign/4 works
2017-02-07 08:16:40	BeerLover	ciawal but i already have keys that were generated and are in use in other apps
2017-02-07 08:16:58	BeerLover	the curve for that is secp521r1
2017-02-07 08:17:02	ciawal	I'm only saying this demonstrates that the problem is with your privateKey value…
2017-02-07 08:17:27	BeerLover	but using :public_key.sign() and :public_key.verify() is working...
2017-02-07 08:17:36	BeerLover	what can be the issue?

2017-02-07 08:19:21	voltone	BeerLover: :public_key.sign/3 is a thin wrapper around :crypto.sign/4
2017-02-07 08:19:29	voltone	you can see what it does here: https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint/lib/public_key/src/public_key.erl#L470
2017-02-07 08:20:09	voltone	for most use cases there is no need to deal with :crypto directly, you can just use the more convenient functions in :public_key
2017-02-07 08:21:49	BeerLover	voltone but i don't specify any algorithm in :public_key
2017-02-07 08:22:12	BeerLover	it does that automatically

2017-02-07 12:43:42	ericmj	dont we already have a language server used my multiple editors?
2017-02-07 12:44:08	micmus	There's alchemist-server which is awesome, but I think it could be better
2017-02-07 12:44:17	fishcakez	I think to write a code formatting tool one first needs to rewritr the language :trollface:

2017-02-07 12:44:57	ericmj	micmus: can you elaborate on the language server?
2017-02-07 12:45:53	micmus	Or a convenient tracing library. Or a good sequential debugger (it's still useful for debugging pure functions)
2017-02-07 12:46:36	micmus	ericmj: for example there's a protocol defined by M$ https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol I think following a standard could be a good idea
2017-02-07 12:46:46	fishcakez	Tracing would just be API design tho, not sure if that's suitable?
2017-02-07 12:46:51	micmus	The main issue right now is that to find syntax errors you need to compile code

2017-02-07 12:48:48	Ankhers	When building an ecto adapter, how would one go about adding support for a database feature that Ecto does not understand? An example would be JavaScript support within Mongo. where/2 expects a keyword list and I seem unable to create my own keywords.
2017-02-07 12:49:08	micmus	We have great low-level tooling, but the APIs are often awkward
2017-02-07 12:49:12	ericmj	Ankhers: ecto fragments can solve that
2017-02-07 12:49:40	ericmj	micmus: it’s a great idea but it sounds too narrow for gsoc though
2017-02-07 12:49:47	ericmj	if it’s about wrapping an API
2017-02-07 12:49:55	Ankhers	ericmj: Yes, but I am trying to give the user a good interface for using them.
2017-02-07 12:50:31	ericmj	Ankhers: if you want a nice interface for features not in ecto then you probably shouldn’t use ecto :)

2017-02-07 12:56:17	jeregrine	So is anyone familiar with inet:peername and why it might return `returned_non_ip_address()`? Is it just in the case when a VM cannot parse the ip?
2017-02-07 12:56:33	fishcakez	I think HiPE only use is to selectively improve micro benchmarks and crash vm

2017-02-07 13:00:26	fishcakez	Check :ranch_tcp spec because plug would be calling that and bit :inet
2017-02-07 13:00:28	jeregrine	because ranch/cowboy/plug treat the response of {ok, <peer>} as valid and just pass it up
2017-02-07 13:00:43	jeregrine	yea its in ranch

2017-02-07 14:31:18	micmus	project structure: have you though about having Context.update_foo(id, params)
2017-02-07 14:31:25	micmus	and eliminating the get from the controller?
2017-02-07 14:31:38	chrismccord	m_m master will log all incoming events by default in dev, and introduces a new instrumentation hook to let you log
2017-02-07 14:31:49	micmus	This allows for an easy error control, since the update_foo function already returns ok/error tuple

2017-02-07 14:33:59	chrismccord	micmus : but you could also do the authorization in the context. Either is fine and depends where you set your api boundaries. No one size fits all

2017-02-07 14:36:32	micmus	I would probably do rate limiting at even higher level than controller - possibly in the router pipeline as a plug
2017-02-07 14:36:37	cristianR_	Hi
2017-02-07 14:36:57	chrismccord	micmus ; it's tricky because you need to authorize actions the user is taking in many cases

2017-02-07 14:37:15	micmus	authorization is tricky - you do need all the data loaded, so you can't hoist it out (but that would be the ideal)
2017-02-07 14:37:24	chrismccord	"can the user publish a new post?" => "ok they can, have they exceeded the rate limit for publishing new posts"

2017-02-07 14:37:55	micmus	oh yeah, if you rate limit with such a high granularity
2017-02-07 14:38:14	cristianR_	Is there a way to insert an Elixir map into an ETS table and update its fields values without reading the term first?
2017-02-07 14:38:18	micmus	we currently do full API + per URL, it's good enough for most cases
2017-02-07 14:38:27	micmus	no, ets operates on tuples.
2017-02-07 14:38:46	cristianR_	Any alternatives for such case?
2017-02-07 14:39:10	chrismccord	micmus : but back to your original point, I could go either way. Would you return `{:error, :not_found}` from update in that case?
2017-02-07 14:39:22	chrismccord	micmus : josevalim will be a hard no on this if that's the case :)

2017-02-07 14:45:36	chrismccord	micmus : also, josevalim is strictly against generating Repo.fetch style `get_*`'s. So in the case of update_post(id, params), we'd have to internally call get_post! and the fact that it could raise would make the controller code less clear

2017-02-07 15:37:05	rschmukler	Is there a reason that a DateTime comparison with `>` would return a bogus result? I think I may have found a bug in the standard lib, but want to make sure I'm not crazy... Can others confirm this is unexpected? https://gist.github.com/rschmukler/9abdb650a4d7f7cb360b33d72d108d60

2017-02-07 15:37:37	jeregrine	fishcakez could you explain further and or link me to a better example. We want to do exception tracking "right" but as far as we could tell this was the most consistent way to handle errors
2017-02-07 15:37:54	laut	@rschmukler you can't use > or < to compare. You have to use functions for it
2017-02-07 15:38:23	laut	@rschmukler the reason it works like that is that > (and similar) just compares them as structs
2017-02-07 15:38:24	rschmukler	laut: well that simplifies things doesn't it? Darn, was hoping to have DateTime comparisons in guard clauses...

2017-02-07 15:41:25	jeregrine	micmus for the json blog post are you just pulling the JSON data from postgres or mongo as a binary, skipping the json type?
2017-02-07 15:41:54	micmus	yeah, with postgres you can explicitly cast to `::text` if you store as json internally

2017-02-07 15:45:56	alisdair	jeregrine: it's pretty neat. i don't know about the implementation but the idea is interesting. it's just an http/rest proxy to postgres directly
2017-02-07 15:46:14	jeregrine	pretty rare I need only the data from postgres
2017-02-07 15:46:22	jeregrine	pretty rare that I use postgres roles

2017-02-07 16:30:09	fishcakez	jeregrine: ok, firstly sentry-elixir is handling error_info from a crash report in a very poor way such that it gets it wrong a lot or shows a poor message
2017-02-07 16:30:25	jeregrine	https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/blob/master/lib/sentry/logger.ex#L26 so this basically
2017-02-07 16:30:56	fishcakez	the function is more equivalent to this case: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/blob/master/lib/sentry/logger.ex#L34

2017-02-07 16:31:40	jeregrine	now I follow
2017-02-07 16:31:41	fishcakez	but really you need to change quite abit because capture_exception/2 is not right
2017-02-07 16:31:49	fishcakez	there are exits, errors and throws
2017-02-07 16:31:59	jeregrine	can do
2017-02-07 16:32:03	fishcakez	not everything is an exception
2017-02-07 16:32:10	jeregrine	right
2017-02-07 16:32:19	jeregrine	we can fix this

2017-02-07 16:33:02	fishcakez	the gist creates a string to define the type of exception, a string as message and then the stacktrace
2017-02-07 16:34:28	fishcakez	jeregrine: it also handles a lot of https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-elixir/blob/master/lib/sentry/event.ex#L107
2017-02-07 16:34:46	jeregrine	right cool, we're righting up an issue, and will fix
2017-02-07 16:34:48	fishcakez	because that logic is not qutie right either, you need to pass the stacktrace to normalize
2017-02-07 16:34:51	jeregrine	thanks for letting me know
2017-02-07 16:35:01	fishcakez	otherwise it will pick the wrong stacktrace and sometimes give the incorrect error
2017-02-07 16:36:12	fishcakez	(it can never pick the correct stacktrace, so i guess it will always be wrong)
2017-02-07 16:36:24	fishcakez	but that only matters when it needs the stacktrace
2017-02-07 16:38:17	whatyouhide	micmus: yes

2017-02-07 16:38:27	whatyouhide	basically we'll stop having a Logger backend
2017-02-07 16:38:34	whatyouhide	and start having an error_logger backend
2017-02-07 16:38:47	whatyouhide	that will report crashes from Task, GenEvent handlers, GenServers etc
2017-02-07 16:39:15	whatyouhide	with rich data and insights about the actual error reason, so that things will be grouped like regular exceptions, and not as just "messages"

2017-02-07 16:43:07	alisdair	error_logger doesn't do any backpressure or load shedding

2017-02-07 16:44:00	jeregrine	right the wrong parts
2017-02-07 16:44:10	jeregrine	that I wrote and or reviewed :-)
2017-02-07 16:44:45	fishcakez	i find it extremely frustrating that libraries to format errors are handling them incorrect because people will use that to try to debug and will be getting incorrect or poor information

2017-02-07 16:47:34	elixirlang180	Reading a recent blog post on Phoenix, it was stated that Phoenix is "just OTP," and that it stops you from thinking solely in terms of the request/response cycle. I'm not quite sure what that means--could anyone clarify the latter statement?
2017-02-07 16:48:02	micmus	josevalim: should we add a deprecation notice to Ecto.Date* modules?
2017-02-07 16:48:23	micmus	There's a lot of people on slack using functions from Ecto.DateTime to process current values
2017-02-07 16:48:34	micmus	I think I just answerd 3rd question about it today
2017-02-07 16:50:23	whatyouhide	alisdair: it doesnt, but for our use case that's just gonna mean you'll get a ton of errors on rollbar
2017-02-07 16:50:32	whatyouhide	if you get that many crashes
2017-02-07 16:50:33	fishcakez	elixirlang180: what I think it means is that when you use Phoenix you have an OTP application, and then http requests in Phoenix interact with your OTP application

2017-02-07 16:52:18	fishcakez	A Phoenix endpoint is more like a `:supervisor_bridge` in that is OTP at the top and provides supervision of non OTP processes below (plug processes are non otp processes)

2017-02-07 16:53:39	elixirlang180	fishcakez: ah, okay. forgive my ignorance (beginner here), but what's the difference as compared to, say, rails?
2017-02-07 16:53:46	whatyouhide	or better, GH gist or just gist as in pre-github meaning of the word gist

2017-02-07 16:54:52	whatyouhide	thanks
2017-02-07 16:55:25	fishcakez	elixirlang180: er im not familiar with rails but i guess it would be like writing a standalone ruby application and then adding a very light rails app to interface with it
2017-02-07 16:55:40	fishcakez	rather than just writing everything in rails
2017-02-07 16:56:00	fishcakez	that means your application exists outside the context of HTTP and works without the HTTP layer
2017-02-07 16:57:18	whatyouhide	fishcakez: yeah what you're doing in the gist is what we're doing already in the Rollbax PR
2017-02-07 16:58:02	whatyouhide	fishcakez: also, we're not reporting crash_reports, but regular error formats in the form of say "gen_server terminating ..." like the ones we translate in Logger.Translator
2017-02-07 16:58:47	whatyouhide	we started out with crash_reports, but seems like a lot of info we could avoid and then some
2017-02-07 16:58:48	fishcakez	whatyouhide: it is not equivalent to the PR
2017-02-07 16:59:05	whatyouhide	while these error reports are more brittle, they seem to provide more useful info

2017-02-07 17:38:31	shankardevy	I am having issue with importing material component in my scss file. I am using brunch as in default phoenix project setup with sass-brunch. I installed `npm install —save @material/ripple`. Now when I import using `import “@material/ripple”`, I get the following error:
2017-02-07 17:38:45	shankardevy	error: Compiling of web/static/css/app.scss failed. Error: File to import not found or unreadable: @material/ripple.
2017-02-07 17:40:14	shankardevy	any help in resolving this? How do I make sass-brunch import the correct sass from node_modules?

2017-02-07 17:53:21	shankardevy	however, since many files from ‘material-component-web’ use the import statement as `@material/component_name`, I need sass-brunch to work in this format without manually changing every import statement.
2017-02-07 17:54:21	shankardevy	for eg., see how the import statements are mentioned here: https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-ripple

2017-02-07 20:36:39	benwilson512	elixir 1.3.3 on 19.2 didn't help

2017-02-07 20:37:14	benwilson512	oh I wonder if it's a rebar vs rebar3 thing
2017-02-07 20:37:25	ericmj	nah
2017-02-07 20:37:50	ericmj	if it works differently in elixir 1.3.3 and 1.4.1 it’s likely because of the rebar.config bugs we fixed in 1.4.1
2017-02-07 20:38:00	benwilson512	gotcha

2017-02-07 20:38:34	benwilson512	so did you find a procedure that worked?
2017-02-07 20:38:49	ericmj	if elixir 1.3.3 adds the eiconv dep to the project then it would explain why mailman thinks it needs to add the eiconv dep manually
2017-02-07 20:38:58	ericmj	benwilson512: fork mailman and remove eiconv

2017-04-01 12:51:44	MrFrog	hey i'm working in phoenix and wrote a controller test to cover when someone's password is invalid and they're updating. for some reason when running tests though i get some "warn" level log entry including `message="The password is too short. At least 8 characters."` in it - what's the right way to clean up my test output when something like that is on purpose?
2017-04-01 12:52:22	MrFrog	the test is passing and correct - it's just annoying to end up with a bunch of warn messages in the middle of my output for tests like the one i'm describing

2017-04-01 12:54:38	MrFrog	stephen_m: makes sense, i'm wondering what the "normal" setting is for a project - do people just keep the warns in there? (i didn't set the project up so i'm not sure how close to "normal" it is)
2017-04-01 12:54:49	stephen_m	I set it to error
2017-04-01 12:55:05	stephen_m	but i noticed the default from a generator seems to be :warn.

2017-04-01 13:13:28	elixir1928	Hi everyone. I'm wondering why the following code doesn't work as expected: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/86c848d0032ac046f1778121bf1d7d16 The code should do the following: take an integer, flip a coin and depending on either heads or tails, double the number or halve it. Then repeat 500 iterations.
2017-04-01 13:13:31	ejpcmac	It’s possible to set the locale with Timex.lformat!, but I think there should be a cleaner way

2017-04-01 13:27:55	asonge	if you wanted to run it 500 times, you'd just pass the range in straight (ranges implement the protocol so you can use them with Enum functions)
2017-04-01 13:27:56	stephen_m	*actually, no, it seems you are using the accumulator to divide by 2.

2017-04-01 13:30:04	asonge	i'd like to point out that benwilson512 told you that, you just misunderstood :)
2017-04-01 13:30:22	asonge	elixir1928: also, that's not 100% the fastest way, but it's certainly idiomatic(-ish)

2017-04-01 13:31:41	asonge	recursive function would be faster, technically. though i don't actually know which one right off the bat (there's a weird thing where tail-call recursive and body recursive functions can be very similarly fast)

2017-04-01 13:32:32	elixir1928	asonge: oh interesting. why would the recursive function be faster?
2017-04-01 13:32:57	stephen_m	1..500 |> Enum.into([]) gives the list.
2017-04-01 13:33:00	asonge	it's basically how Enum.reduce is implemented in the end.
2017-04-01 13:33:54	elixir1928	stephen_m: yup, though asonge pointed out that ranges implement the Enum protocol so you can use them straight.
2017-04-01 13:34:02	asonge	the abstraction isn't free, it just doesn't matter most of the time. plus, writing recursive functions is often not as easily compositional (the logic for recursing is mixed with the logic for transformation, making switching abstractions harder)
2017-04-01 13:34:04	stephen_m	yea, true
2017-04-01 13:34:29	elixir1928	asonge: ah, gotcha
2017-04-01 13:34:48	elixir1928	I've actually got to run, but thanks again for the help. :)
2017-04-01 13:34:53	asonge	an Enum.reduce function can go into Stream.reduce and Flow.reduce...or anything else.

2017-08-07 01:07:15	gugahoa	Hello everyone. I'm reading `Elixir in Action`, currently at chapter 5, and he talks about send/receive in that chapter.
2017-08-07 01:07:20	gugahoa	It says `Sending a message amounts to storing it into the receiver’s mailbox`
2017-08-07 01:07:34	gugahoa	and that the `receive` construct works in 6 simple steps
2017-08-07 01:07:45	-->	kronicdeth (~textual@cpe-70-121-97-113.austin.res.rr.com) has joined #elixir-lang
2017-08-07 01:08:03	gugahoa	1.  Take the first message from the mailbox.
2017-08-07 01:08:03	gugahoa	2.  Try to match it against any of the provided patterns, going from top to bottom.
2017-08-07 01:08:04	gugahoa	3.  If a pattern matches the message, run the corresponding code.
2017-08-07 01:08:04	gugahoa	4.  If no pattern matches, put the message back into the mailbox at the same position it originally occupied. Then try the next message.
2017-08-07 01:08:04	gugahoa	5.  If there are no more messages in the queue, wait for a new one to arrive. When a new message arrives, start from step 1, inspecting the first message in the mailbox.
2017-08-07 01:08:06	gugahoa	6.  If the after clause is specified and no message arrives in the given amount of time, run the code from the after block.
2017-08-07 01:08:26	gugahoa	What I'm curious is what happens if the process crashes in the middle of the `receive` block
2017-08-07 01:08:59	gugahoa	(Sorry for the wall of text)
2017-08-07 01:09:31	benwilson512	gugahoa: are you asking what happens to other messages in the process mailbox?
2017-08-07 01:10:14	gugahoa	What happens with the whole process and mailbox in this scenario?
2017-08-07 01:10:32	benwilson512	if the process crashes the whole processes crashes, and that includes its mailbox
2017-08-07 01:11:09	gugahoa	Then if I wanted for the delivery of messages to be fault tolerant, what could I do?

2017-08-07 01:11:27	benwilson512	gugahoa: the sender of the message should not consider it received unless it gets an acknowledgement back
2017-08-07 01:11:39	benwilson512	gugahoa: this is a crucial part of ensuring fault tolerance
2017-08-07 01:12:03	gugahoa	thanks, benwilson512 !

2017-12-06 09:50:25	micmus	josevalim: the primary problem with optimizing map.field is that one branch it compiles to is potentially not pure, so we can't really move it around

2017-12-06 09:56:40	micmus	It's a very WIP solution, but it works for now

2017-12-06 09:57:16	micmus	Yeah, I'd need to play with it a bit, but I'm not sure we can get better code than we do today
2017-12-06 09:58:43	micmus	and also measure the perf impact
2017-12-06 10:00:02	micmus	josevalim: but I think our best bet would be improving type-guided optimizations in beam_type - this could allow statically dispatching this for a lot of cases

2017-12-06 22:14:19	cmrabet	Hi all
2017-12-06 22:14:27	cmrabet	I'm new on Elixir, I've been developing for Node.js for 4 years now and just discovered this awesome language. I've been learning for a week now and just started today with Phoenix. Quick question, if I go with react.js for the front end, I won't need any of the views managing system Phoenix comes with, and therefore I won't need the controllers either -I just want the backend to be an API server with GraphQL-, so if I strip Phoenix of all that..
2017-12-06 22:14:27	cmrabet	does it make any sense to use Phoenix at all or should I just go ahead with a simple program with Plugs and Ecto? Thanks.
2017-12-06 22:15:38	alisdair	cmrabet: i think plug is fine for a straightforward api, but some people still find value in phoenix
2017-12-06 22:16:56	cmrabet	alisdair, what I need is to implement an end point that serves data via GraphQL to clients written with react
2017-12-06 22:17:18	Uniaika	cmrabet: go with Absinthe-GraphQL and Plug if that's what suits you
2017-12-06 22:17:25	alisdair	oh then you don't need phoenix at all, check out absinthe tho
2017-12-06 22:17:39	cmrabet	exactly, that's what I'm saying
2017-12-06 22:18:15	cmrabet	with Plugs from what I've seen I can also handle sessions
2017-12-06 22:18:45	cmrabet	Form what I've seen, plugs seem to be like middleware in node
2017-12-06 22:19:02	cmrabet	handling requests and returning responses

2018-01-20 12:17:09	fschuindt	Hello there folks, I'm looking forward to buy a Elixir book, I think I'm going for Dave Thomas' Programming Elixir. But I want the paper book, and the Prgramming Elixir 1.6 book isn't available as paper until April. So I'm probably going to buy the 1.3 version. Should I wait for the 1.6 version or reading the 1.3 is ok?

2018-01-20 12:53:26	egis	Or am I missing something?

2018-01-20 13:24:29	FatalNIX	I am not quite sure. I came up with this idea for my game's event handling called Certifictes. The idea is that they can be used like event vouchers, checked like access control list code, or whatever. Every certificate has some sort of standard outer shell, but the data on the inside of a certfiicate varies.

2018-01-20 18:05:29	dysfun	what i find writing library stuff at the minute is i have two variants of many functions (! and no-!) and while it's easy to write the ! variant in terms of the non-! variant, when you're performing a few operations in sequence for the non-! variants, you end up doing a lot of unpacking with case

2018-01-20 19:17:43	nickjj	for the people who have dockerized their elixir set ups, how would you deal with the mix.lock file in development? it seems a bit more strict than ruby's gemfile.lock
2018-01-20 19:18:28	<--	ewan (~user@95.149.238.188) has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
2018-01-20 19:19:08	nickjj	for example, at docker build time, you could COPY mix* ./ and then run through your typical mix install steps, but at runtime when you volume mount in your app code, no mix.lock file will be present (which overrides the built mix.lock) and phx.server will have a melt down
2018-01-20 19:19:46	nickjj	i think one way to get around this would be to dockerignore the mix.lock file but that seems potentially dangerous, any thoughts?

2018-01-20 19:21:38	alisdair	why volume mount your app code?
2018-01-20 19:22:40	alisdair	i COPY `mix.ex` and `mix.lock`, get and compile deps, then COPY app code and build the app
2018-01-20 19:23:45	nickjj	alisdair, for development
2018-01-20 19:24:12	nickjj	your flow is what i'm doing now too , but then at runtime i slap in a .:/app volume mount
2018-01-20 19:24:27	nickjj	this way if i make a change to a file, it reflects without having to do another docker build
2018-01-20 19:25:34	alisdair	i just use `docker-compose up --build`
2018-01-20 19:25:44	alisdair	the extra time to COPY in the app code is neglible
2018-01-20 19:26:21	nickjj	but what happens when you make a change to a template or elixir file
2018-01-20 19:26:30	nickjj	you just rebuild manually, that's not a fun development environment
2018-01-20 19:26:57	alisdair	oh i never use autocompilers/reloaders
2018-01-20 19:27:18	alisdair	i run tests every compile cycle, i do zero interactive testing

2018-01-20 20:41:45	johnjohn101	the return value
2018-01-20 20:43:56	johnjohn101	%Tds.Result{columns: ["name"], num_rows: 2, rows: [["henry"], ["ronald"]]}
2018-01-20 20:44:30	benwilson512	can you elaborate a bit on how you're making the query? is this with ecto? postgrex?
2018-01-20 20:44:41	johnjohn101	tds
2018-01-20 20:44:54	benwilson512	ah
2018-01-20 20:45:15	johnjohn101	it's the same problem i had when i was doing erlang odbc
2018-01-20 20:45:55	benwilson512	gotcha, and what's that problem then?
2018-01-20 20:46:41	johnjohn101	want to loop over the results and print
2018-01-20 20:47:13	johnjohn101	name
2018-01-20 20:47:19	johnjohn101	henry
2018-01-20 20:47:24	johnjohn101	ronald
2018-01-20 20:47:30	benwilson512	sure
2018-01-20 20:47:47	benwilson512	I will say, the TDS library looks compatible with ecto, which may provide a more ergonomic set of tools here
2018-01-20 20:47:49	johnjohn101	getting back to thinking functionally is just a bit baffly
2018-01-20 20:47:58	benwilson512	but to answer your exact question

2018-01-20 20:49:39	johnjohn101	for loops :)
2018-01-20 20:49:45	benwilson512	for loops work here too

2018-01-20 20:52:02	benwilson512	printing in Elixir is just a pretty regular side effect, so the code isn't even all that functional
2018-01-20 20:53:10	benwilson512	if there's more columns we'd have to take a different approach

2018-01-20 20:53:45	johnjohn101	but this is a good start
2018-01-20 20:54:19	benwilson512	I'd very much consider using ecto however because you'd get a response here that looked like

2018-01-20 20:54:45	benwilson512	usually
2018-01-20 20:55:25	benwilson512	if there were several columns however and we wanted a single string

2018-01-20 20:55:33	benwilson512	you could look at
2018-01-20 20:56:13	benwilson512	well again I mean is the ultimate end goal to print a table to console?

2018-01-22 11:27:14	mercerist	presence would be a bit overkill in this case though, perhaps

2018-01-22 11:27:42	mercerist	I have two clients (and rarely more) where one presents controls and the other presents a nice video
2018-01-22 11:27:43	OliverMT	its almost literally the base use case for presence
2018-01-22 11:27:53	mercerist	all in a user-specific channel
2018-01-22 11:28:03	OliverMT	to know who is in a channel
2018-01-22 11:28:07	mercerist	so basically I just need the controls to know when anyone leaves the channel
2018-01-22 11:28:11	mercerist	because it would have to be the viewer
2018-01-22 11:28:25	mercerist	(multiple views are not a thing yet)
2018-01-22 11:28:28	OliverMT	this is a 5min thing to solve with Phoenix.Presence :)
2018-01-22 11:28:30	mercerist	still presence?
2018-01-22 11:28:42	dysfun	why don't you want to use presence?

2018-01-22 11:29:09	mercerist	mostly that it's yet another concept and more code, but if it doesn't have much overhead and it's fine for this use case, I will do that
2018-01-22 11:29:19	mercerist	been meaning to play with presence anyways
2018-01-22 11:29:43	dysfun	it's a pretty simple concept and not much code
2018-01-22 11:29:53	mercerist	so I gather in the name of getting this prototype done you'd still say presence is  quickest?
2018-01-22 11:30:04	dysfun	presence solves it properly
2018-01-22 11:30:09	mercerist	yeah, I get that
2018-01-22 11:30:22	dysfun	there's really no need to not use it
2018-01-22 11:30:24	mercerist	I'm just asking if there's maybe a simple 'leave' message or callback
2018-01-22 11:30:29	mercerist	the reason would be time constraints
2018-01-22 11:30:52	OliverMT	there is leave/3
2018-01-22 11:30:59	mercerist	O_o
2018-01-22 11:31:08	OliverMT	but it's a hack and predates presence being implemented
2018-01-22 11:31:19	mercerist	ah, right. so not recommended.
2018-01-22 11:31:21	OliverMT	it's also dob le triggered, both on channel leave and on socket disconnect
2018-01-22 11:31:27	OliverMT	"hack" is wrong word
2018-01-22 11:31:29	mercerist	in this case that'd be fine
2018-01-22 11:34:21	mercerist	hmm, can't seem to get it working with 'leave'.
2018-01-22 11:34:43	 *	dysfun is shocked
2018-01-22 11:34:58	mercerist	hehe
2018-01-22 11:34:58	 *	dysfun hands mercerist a presence
2018-01-22 11:35:02	mercerist	yeah yeah
2018-01-22 11:35:30	mercerist	ok, I'll just assume connections will magically not break for now and do it the proper presence way later. thanks for the help either way!
2018-01-22 11:36:04	mercerist	plus multiple viewers will probably become a thing eventually, and then I'd need it anyways

2018-01-22 11:44:43	OliverMT	the socket system itself does the pinging here though
2018-01-22 11:44:48	OliverMT	that is what triggers leave/3
2018-01-22 11:44:51	OliverMT	but its still a hack

2018-01-22 11:47:24	OliverMT	I havent coded channels in many months, haste took over my code on that project :P
2018-01-22 11:50:52	hmans	OliverMT is correct, Phoenix Channels implement their own health checks.

2018-01-22 12:32:53	entwanderer	hey guys! Just playing around with phoenix and using sessions. When i create a plain project without ecto and add the following lines into the controller, the session value is always empty:
2018-01-22 12:33:04	entwanderer	  def index(conn, _params) do     put_session(conn, :content, "ConTent")     content = get_session(conn, :content)     render conn, "index.html", content: content   end
2018-01-22 12:33:20	Nicd-	values in Elixir are immutable
2018-01-22 12:33:29	Nicd-	your first put_session modifies the conn and then throws the modified conn away
2018-01-22 12:33:44	Nicd-	it will return a modified conn and you need to store that somewhere
2018-01-22 12:34:34	Nicd-	so for example: `conn = put_session(conn, :content, "ConTent")`
2018-01-22 12:35:09	--	karreiro is now known as karreiro_afk
2018-01-22 12:36:10	entwanderer	is there a best practice? (i expected to framework has a standard magic store solution to store them, so i don't have to care about)

2018-01-22 12:40:50	entwanderer	Thank you very much for your explanations. Your example is working, the value is stored until the next reload ... i will play around and find out where i was thinking the wrong way

2018-01-22 12:42:44	Nicd-	basically you cannot modify variable contents in Elixir. you will get a new value instead, or you can point the variable elsewhere but the data still remains

2018-01-22 12:43:08	Nicd-	that's why the call to put_session cannot modify the connection (conn), instead it will return a new conn that you can give to the next call
2018-01-22 12:43:37	entwanderer	so the return of render is the conn?

2018-01-22 12:45:12	benwilson512	it is indeed a conn
2018-01-22 12:45:18	Nicd-	yeah just checked

2018-01-22 14:13:41	benwilson512	but perhaps a better point is, I don't think the compiler has enough information to do exhaustiveness checks on guards
2018-01-22 14:13:45	benwilson512	maybe dialyzer can
2018-01-22 14:13:46	inoas	saw an elm talk... like that
2018-01-22 14:13:52	benwilson512	sure, but elm has a static type system
2018-01-22 14:13:56	inoas	ok
2018-01-22 14:14:29	benwilson512	`n` doesn't even need to be an integer for that to work in Elixir

2018-01-22 14:18:17	inoas	how would I abort the chain in case one rule doesnt return ok?
2018-01-22 14:18:21	inoas	I don
2018-01-22 14:18:24	asonge	you could also just write a function with all the conditions joined by `and`
2018-01-22 14:18:30	inoas	t want to raise an exception, just iterate
2018-01-22 14:18:33	dysfun	you can reverse all the conditions. if not thing then fail, if not other thing then fail, finally success
2018-01-22 14:19:00	inoas	asonge so just if ... all conditions ... iterate, else ... exit/return
2018-01-22 14:19:18	inoas	why reverse the conditions ?
2018-01-22 14:19:52	dysfun	because that gives the behaviour you requested of abort if a rule doesn't return ok
2018-01-22 14:19:57	benwilson512	conditions as functions then just reduce while
2018-01-22 14:20:13	benwilson512	or just reduce, depending on whether you want to stop at the first error
2018-01-22 14:20:17	benwilson512	or try all errors
2018-01-22 14:20:18	asonge	inoas: if you have a really complicated conditional, just break it out into a function, and then use if or cond or case (as needed)
2018-01-22 14:20:42	asonge	why are we trying to iterate?

2018-01-22 14:25:39	inoas	MapSet pretty much sound like that weirdo thing php calls 'array' :)
2018-01-22 14:25:42	asonge	right, it's not on there, but finding something in a list is O(n), finding a key in a map is O(log n)
2018-01-22 14:25:58	inoas	I remembered that finding it in a list is bad
2018-01-22 14:26:07	inoas	worst case it has to iterate through the whole list
2018-01-22 14:26:08	asonge	so a MapSet is a Map where the keys are the things in the set, and the values are just...whatever.
2018-01-22 14:27:01	inoas	I dont know how maps work internally though (aka why they are faster), maybe have a list of memory addresses for each key instead of a chained list like with real lists?
2018-01-22 14:27:35	asonge	it's a hash trie, but Map is actually similar to PHP's array internally
2018-01-22 14:27:44	asonge	but lists are *not*

2018-01-22 14:43:41	inoas	so whenever I need that undefined junk of php-array and cannot use something more specific like key/value or real lists I should look for mapset... it seems

2018-01-22 17:57:56	dysfun	with one field, no, because 'timestamp with time zone' is actually not, under the hood
2018-01-22 18:00:19	johnjohn101	doesn't ISO have a way to do this/
2018-01-22 18:00:38	metoo2	That's what I figured. I'm trying to account for time duration when the start and end times may overlap with a change from DST to standard time. I think the best thing will be just detecting the change in DST status, and adding a single duration_offset field that figures that stuff out when updating the start or end times.
2018-01-22 18:00:45	dysfun	if you mean ISO8601, that deals with the textual representation of datetimes, not database storage
2018-01-22 18:01:25	asonge	i thought postgresql's timestamp with time zone actually stored the representation of the timezone?
2018-01-22 18:01:27	dysfun	metoo2: the "correct" way of doing this for a future event is actually to store local time and offset, though it has its own difficulties
2018-01-22 18:01:42	dysfun	asonge: no, it normalises to the system time zone (which i hope is utc)

2018-01-22 18:03:26	asonge	i've never had to deal with future events that might be affected by tz changes
2018-01-22 18:03:28	metoo2	Okay. So this solution then. 2 date time fields (start and end). 2 hidden date time fields that update when the start and end times are changed and use momentjs to detect the time zone offset for each.
2018-01-22 18:03:35	Nicd-	'timestamp with timezone' should just be removed IMO :/

2018-01-23 16:11:34	asonge	jer: you shouldn't use models, but you can use the schemaless ecto API
2018-01-23 16:11:52	jer	ok
2018-01-23 16:12:44	asonge	this also sounds like something where you might be able to write it with 1 single query, rather than rely on more complicated ecto bits
2018-01-23 16:13:25	jer	so i couldn't do something using Ecto.Query to do a from u in users, where: u.organization_id == nil, select u.id; and use the result set of that to insert a new org for that user?

2018-02-23 18:51:01	fishcakez	oh its like that :P
2018-02-23 18:51:19	josevalim	since your solution assumes the user owns the server, then they should do start_link(_opts) and just ignore the options for now
2018-02-23 18:51:39	josevalim	but if they do not own the server, then something like `Supervisor.start_link(ModuleThatIsNotMine, arguments: [])` is the way to go
2018-02-23 18:51:39	josevalim	right?
2018-02-23 18:52:18	fishcakez	Im not sure that example is the solution to anything

2018-02-23 19:02:33	fishcakez	josevalim: oh right you meant child_spec/2 not start_link/2

2018-02-23 19:03:07	fishcakez	josevalim: im not sure it matters in this case
2018-02-23 19:03:24	fishcakez	the child_spec/2 call will still give the right args if there are none

2018-02-26 19:50:55	dysfun	and actually, most server side stuff is way less complicated than user interfaces
2018-02-26 19:51:24	kapil___	:)
2018-02-26 19:51:57	dysfun	i don't think so. there is a tool called 'pulp' for building, you don't need to write a config for it though
2018-02-26 19:52:20	dysfun	the halogen walkthrough/examples should give you the code
2018-02-26 19:52:49	kapil___	ok i will spend some time with halogen and then talk with you
2018-02-26 19:53:44	dysfun	`pulp -w build --to dist/app.js`
2018-02-26 19:54:35	kapil___	is there something like hot-reloding? its must
2018-02-26 19:55:00	dysfun	not directly. i use parcel for that. it's a no-config bundler
2018-02-26 19:56:25	dysfun	although tbh it's quite rare i even bother looking at my browser. i can just run away at the pace of my thoughts so long as the code compiles

2018-03-01 11:00:34	ggVGc	would you say it's acceptable to do a database query in order to validate a changeset?
2018-03-01 11:01:22	OliverMT	if by that you mean accessing Repo from the changeset, thats a big no no
2018-03-01 11:01:31	ggVGc	right
2018-03-01 11:01:47	OliverMT	if by that you mean using Repo outside the schema, while setting things up, then passing in the validation paramters as a virtual attr or in the changeset params, then yes
2018-03-01 11:01:50	ggVGc	so, what's the common way to prevent for example a duplicate entry in the database?
2018-03-01 11:01:58	OliverMT	validate_unique
2018-03-01 11:02:01	OliverMT	it uses database constraints
2018-03-01 11:02:05	OliverMT	so it's not explicit repo usage
2018-03-01 11:02:08	ggVGc	ah, yeah, good
2018-03-01 11:02:13	ggVGc	sorry, bit tired :(
2018-03-01 11:02:14	ggVGc	thanks
2018-03-01 11:02:51	OliverMT	you can validate_unique multiple times referencing the same constraint
2018-03-01 11:03:05	OliverMT	so if you ahve a unique constraint over a foreign key, some X thing being true and then the "name" variable
2018-03-01 11:03:33	OliverMT	you can validate_unique on the FK, the X thing *and* the name, using name: "name_of_the_unique_constraint"
2018-03-01 11:03:43	OliverMT	or just on the name
2018-03-01 11:03:47	OliverMT	depending on how you want your errors to look

2018-03-01 12:39:03	Liru	I'm currently doing normal html and replacing necessary parts with the relevant eex tags, so it seems a bit clunky
2018-03-01 12:39:10	asonge	Liru: phoenix has a live reloader in dev mode, and when you change a template file, it'll reload
2018-03-01 12:40:11	Liru	Oh, the live reloader does that? Hasn't been working for me for some reason

2018-03-01 12:43:20	Liru	It's going to be behind nginx anyway, most likely
2018-03-01 12:43:44	asonge	i usually skip nginx
2018-03-01 12:43:56	Liru	Also, never heard of slime. Also also, will look into using markdown templates
2018-03-01 12:44:39	asonge	oh, they're nice for different things...mostly to do with email text templates in markdown and sometimes something haml-y like slime is easier to read
2018-03-01 12:45:05	asonge	but i usually deploy on docker, forward host 80 to 4000 inside the container, and if i want static assets served by something, i use a CDN layer
2018-03-01 12:45:53	asonge	having another webserver on the same host just seems like a potential bottleneck more than anything else (particularly with the low connection limit between 2 tcp servers on the same host)

2018-03-01 12:49:26	nickjj	there's no special websocket port right?
2018-03-01 12:49:36	nickjj	i mean, it would end up being the same port you expose phoenix on?
2018-03-01 12:49:50	nickjj	or cowboy specifically
2018-03-01 12:50:29	Liru	nickjj: Yeah, but it gets iffy when you proxy through aanother server
2018-03-01 12:50:30	@benwilson512	same port yes but you gotta configure nginx to do the connection upgrade
2018-03-01 12:50:45	Liru	^
2018-03-01 12:51:01	nickjj	it's interesting because i have my phoenix app dockerized and live reload only works for assets, not template changes

2018-03-01 15:20:42	ryanwinchester	So. I have an ETS table for rate-limiting and the bucket names are currently just what I get from `x_forwarded_for`, e.g. `"10.175.214.149, 210.15.252.249, 202.45.119.141, 192.168.255.57"`
2018-03-01 15:21:03	ryanwinchester	i'm finding the ETS table is eating up quite a bit of memory because there are lots of requests
2018-03-01 15:21:21	ryanwinchester	would it be better to parse those into IP tuples?
2018-03-01 15:21:30	ryanwinchester	(can i have a tuple as a bucket name?)
2018-03-01 15:21:55	ryanwinchester	(maybe make it a charlist?)
2018-03-01 15:22:16	ryanwinchester	or is there a clever way to represent the IPs in an efficient manner

2018-03-01 15:23:34	@benwilson512	ryanwinchester: are you using one of the rate limitting plugs or something hand rolled?

2018-03-01 15:24:18	@benwilson512	ugh https://github.com/grempe/ex_rated/blob/master/lib/ex_rated.ex#L51
2018-03-01 15:24:52	@benwilson512	your problem is probably that ^
2018-03-01 15:25:48	ryanwinchester	ah it has to be a string
2018-03-01 15:25:51	ryanwinchester	hmm
2018-03-01 15:25:57	ryanwinchester	ahh does that also make it single-threaded?
2018-03-01 15:26:01	ryanwinchester	the genserver?
2018-03-01 15:26:05	ryanwinchester	err single process
2018-03-01 15:26:15	@benwilson512	it serializes all http requests through a single genserver
2018-03-01 15:26:16	@benwilson512	yeah
2018-03-01 15:26:35	@benwilson512	I'm skeptical that it's an issue with having ets table keys as binaries, although that'd be a secondary issue
2018-03-01 15:27:05	ryanwinchester	my ETS memory usage grows like 1MB per minute
2018-03-01 15:27:34	@benwilson512	that's no good
2018-03-01 15:27:38	@benwilson512	let me look through the implementation more
2018-03-01 15:27:45	ryanwinchester	we get about 2000 request per second and i added the elixir rewrite as 1/4 of a load balancer
2018-03-01 15:27:55	ryanwinchester	i have a check for requests per second and requests per day
2018-03-01 15:28:05	ryanwinchester	so i think the memory should clear after a day
2018-03-01 15:29:22	ryanwinchester	but i'd still like to reduce the amount it's using because when we drop the other 3/4 of the load balancer and are 100% elixir, that'll be 4MB per minute growth (potentially) haha
2018-03-01 15:29:38	@benwilson512	no I completely agree that 1mb/min is too much
2018-03-01 15:29:47	@benwilson512	I'm just saying that it may not be the key size
2018-03-01 15:30:11	@benwilson512	it may be something else about how the library is using ets.

2018-03-01 15:35:15	ryanwinchester	yeah, the problem with doing that is that the orders aren't right in most cases where there are more than two, which seems roughly 405 of requests

2018-03-01 15:35:58	ryanwinchester	like, i get `"124.246.12.86, 192.168.255.57"` which is fine `client, proxy`
2018-03-01 15:36:08	@benwilson512	ryanwinchester: to make sure I follow correctly: you get 2k req/sec but from how many clients? a very large number?
2018-03-01 15:36:13	ryanwinchester	but then we have stuff like `"192.168.121.140, 74.119.160.47, 192.168.255.57"`
2018-03-01 15:36:34	ryanwinchester	which is `private_ip, client, proxy` (i'm assuming)
2018-03-01 15:36:48	ryanwinchester	benwilson512: yeah it seems to be a very large number
2018-03-01 15:37:18	@benwilson512	ryanwinchester: at some level then while you can try to get some constant factor optimizations, you can't avoid that memory growth will scale with the total number of clients

2018-03-01 15:39:07	ryanwinchester	it checks the rate twice with every request because we're trying to limit requests per second and requests per day :/
2018-03-01 15:39:24	@benwilson512	ah
2018-03-01 15:39:28	ryanwinchester	so that's 2 different bucket names
2018-03-01 15:39:31	@benwilson512	it's likely the requests per day that's accumulating the most memory

2018-03-01 15:39:50	@benwilson512	well, it'll reach an upper limit
2018-03-01 15:40:11	ryanwinchester	yeah, that too i mean there has to be a limit on the number of unique clients
2018-03-01 15:40:14	ryanwinchester	lol
2018-03-01 15:40:23	@benwilson512	right. (unique clients / day) * bucket size
2018-03-01 15:41:03	@benwilson512	ryanwinchester: if you go to the process tab and sort by message queue does any process stand out?

2018-03-01 15:42:58	@benwilson512	ryanwinchester: ultimately I'd try to figure out how to determine which IP address on that list to care about
2018-03-01 15:43:35	ryanwinchester	benwilson512: technically it's supposed to be the head, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For#Format
2018-03-01 15:43:51	@benwilson512	then that's what I'd go for
2018-03-01 15:43:55	ryanwinchester	but realistically it looks like some proxies don't follow the standard
2018-03-01 15:44:01	ryanwinchester	and by some i mean a lot
2018-03-01 15:44:09	@benwilson512	example?
2018-03-01 15:44:25	ryanwinchester	the ones like this i'm getting: "192.168.121.140, 74.119.160.47, 192.168.255.57"
2018-03-01 15:44:32	ryanwinchester	the head is a private IP
2018-03-01 15:44:47	@benwilson512	but that's what you'd want to rate limit anyway
2018-03-01 15:44:56	@benwilson512	2 people behind the same proxy should have their own limits presumably
2018-03-01 15:45:21	@benwilson512	although I suppose 2 people could have the same local ip and be behind 2 proxies
2018-03-01 15:45:27	ryanwinchester	but 2 different people could have the same private IP?
2018-03-01 15:45:31	ryanwinchester	yeah
2018-03-01 15:45:33	@benwilson512	so really you want all IPs up to your own load balancer

2018-03-01 15:47:26	@benwilson512	count_hit could be written from the client side by using update_counter with a default

2018-03-01 15:49:10	jerel	benwilson512: do you happen to know if there's a way to have ex_aws_s3 sign query params? Specifically, enforcing content type on a presigned url
2018-03-01 15:49:12	@benwilson512	you'd just spawn 2 instances, one that swept per day and one that swept per minute or w/e
2018-03-01 15:49:50	@benwilson512	jerel: yeah via the https://hexdocs.pm/ex_aws_s3/ExAws.S3.html#t:presigned_url_opts/0 query_params opt
2018-03-01 15:50:24	jerel	Ok, so those are signed. I must be doing something else wrong in my test as s3 seems to accept the request anyway

2018-03-01 21:48:20	mayhew	I noticed that Plug and Phoenix don't have session locks. I'm curious what you guys think about the concept. Is it not a good tradeoff?
2018-03-01 21:50:58	asonge	mayhew: that would be hard to do right.
2018-03-01 21:51:14	asonge	or rather, easy to do if you want to introduce a single point of failure
2018-03-01 21:52:11	asonge	i was going to say that it might be easier to make stuff idempotent and ordered so if stuff gets interleaved, you can try to resolve it, but hahaha. this is just a hard problem all around and i don't know what you can really do besides try to make stuff idempotent...
2018-03-01 21:55:58	mayhew	asonge: PHP does it with their filesystem-based sessions using the `flock` system call. The problem is that it if you fire multiple ajax requests off at a time, only one will be able to make progress until the lock is released.

2018-03-01 21:56:38	mayhew	and some PHP frameworks say stuff like https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/libraries/sessions.html#a-note-about-concurrency
2018-03-01 21:56:50	asonge	mayhew: and then you can only have 1 server.
2018-03-01 21:57:08	asonge	if you want to try the flock solution on nfs, you're going to have a Bad Time
2018-03-01 21:57:23	mayhew	asonge: that's what we currently do, lol. Bad time indeed.

2018-03-01 21:57:51	asonge	what kinds of operations are you doing on the session?
2018-03-01 21:58:30	mayhew	nothing interesting, but it's the default behaviour and we're noticing latency issues when we fire multiple Ajax requests because again, they're executed serially
2018-03-01 21:58:59	mayhew	so I'm trying to figure out why PHP/CodeIgniter3 is so insistent on them when you guys, Django, Rails, etc. have all opted not to use them and seem to be doing fine :)
2018-03-01 21:59:15	asonge	so, iirc, by default cookie session storage is used, so that means you only have 1 winner
2018-03-01 21:59:30	asonge	it depends on how you use session storage
2018-03-01 21:59:48	mayhew	asonge: yeah, I realize it's impossible to lock the signed cookie based sessions
2018-03-01 22:00:15	mayhew	well not impossible, but .. you'd be going out of your way lol
2018-03-01 22:00:52	asonge	i think you need to think about what kinds of failure modes you want to deal with
2018-03-01 22:01:22	asonge	if some stuff in your session disappears, can you recover?
2018-03-01 22:01:43	asonge	(signed cookie sessions should be really minimal anyway, you want to stick with IDs mostly)

2018-03-02 02:16:58	thither	I've always thought that conditionals could use something like this.
2018-03-02 02:17:57	thither	Sometimes you have a long expression show up twice in an if statement. You could rebind it to a short name - but that's kinda janky.

2018-03-02 02:28:55	kapil___	Thanks
2018-03-02 02:29:08	thither	Honestly I just delete the auto-generated tests and fill them in myself
2018-03-02 02:29:43	thither	Usually the models subtly change soon after the tests get generated anyway
2018-03-02 02:29:48	kapil___	But I don't know why it fails
2018-03-02 02:30:04	thither	It's probably checking that your field is required
2018-03-02 02:30:12	thither	And now it's not so it thinks that's wrong

2018-03-02 15:16:32	bitwalker	they are basically designed to solve the issue of exploding states when you have more than one piece of state that is involved in transitions (i.e. variations on each state require slightly different transitions)

2018-03-02 18:38:59	Enotsoul	Heya Nicd-, watching some documentaries, when I hit one about social media addictions and I remembered my old Irc addiction phase from 10-15 years ago so I figured i'd see how things are and I'm surprised to see IRC is still alive. HOw about you? How did you discover elixir?:D
2018-03-02 18:39:50	Nicd-	25 channels... well, at least it's down from the 46 I had at max
2018-03-02 18:39:54	Nicd-	:D
2018-03-02 18:40:15	Nicd-	I learned of Elixir back in 2013 I think when a friend mentioned it as I was talking to them about learning Erlang
2018-03-02 18:40:37	Nicd-	so I dumped Erlang and went for Elixir instead :P
2018-03-02 18:40:59	bitwalker	josevalim: oooh I like that nimbleparsec lib, that was what I always wanted to do with combine (compile out a lot of the function calls) but was never able to make time for it
2018-03-02 18:41:15	Enotsoul	Nice so this means you've got a lot of cool projects in the meantime, too bad I did'nt find out about it back then:D.

2018-03-02 18:47:08	dysfun	just put "EXPERIMENTAL, not recommend for use" near the top of the README, boom!

2018-03-02 18:53:16	Enotsoul	And the phoenix backend in elixir would connect to IRC? I thought about that too, but I remembered how much overhead there would be..

2018-03-02 19:21:39	bitwalker	Timex itself uses combine for parsing, and I know Sasa was using it as well, and a few others; so I think the interest is definitely there, if I deprecate combine and point people to nimbleparsec, we could at least consolidate around one lib

2018-03-02 19:38:37	bitwalker	You need to use `File.exists?(Application.app_dir(:myapp, "priv/static/" <> path))` instead
2018-03-02 19:39:09	bitwalker	In a release, the root directory is different than when running under MIx, so you need to find the priv directory relative to the application you are pulling resources from

2018-03-05 10:26:21	gazler	CSS
2018-03-05 10:26:27	gazler	It extracts the CSS out of the JS
2018-03-05 10:26:29	josevalim	is it the copy as is plugin?
2018-03-05 10:26:38	josevalim	why is there CSS on JS file?
2018-03-05 10:26:43	gazler	Because webpack.
2018-03-05 10:27:01	josevalim	gazler: do we need to support it by default?
2018-03-05 10:27:04	josevalim	do we use it for now?
2018-03-05 10:27:19	gazler	Yeah, so by default, webpack bundles your CSS with your JS into 1 file.
2018-03-05 10:27:35	gazler	You have to use ExtractTextPlugin to generate a CSS file.

2018-03-05 11:02:17	josevalim	ericmj: for example, in _build you can have dependencies that are not currently enabled, because you have a flag that adds some deps conditionally

2018-03-05 11:03:49	josevalim	ericmj: i really don't think consolidating by hand would be hard. i would write a small elixir script and pass it to -e and just call elixir
2018-03-05 11:03:49	ericmj	josevalim: maybe we can change behavior based on if --consolidation-path is given

2018-03-05 11:06:38	ericmj	josevalim: it is basically Protocol.extract_protocols + Protocol.extract_impls + Protocol.consolidate?

2018-03-05 11:06:48	josevalim	ericmj: given what we discussed, i think it would work better than trying to retrofit mix compile.protocols
2018-03-05 11:07:08	josevalim	ericmj: it should a matter of writing extract protocols, extract impls, calling consolidate and then writing it down to disk
2018-03-05 11:07:25	josevalim	call it as

2018-03-05 13:46:56	josevalim	wojtekmach: i don't like the name .gen
2018-03-05 13:47:02	josevalim	but i also think .compile can be misleading
2018-03-05 13:47:10	josevalim	although we are compiling by definition of compiling?
2018-03-05 13:47:47	wojtekmach	my same exact thoughts re gen and .compile
2018-03-05 13:49:39	wojtekmach	from gen and compile I suppose compile is better. On my test project I continue to have that `compile.parsers` alias so that it recompiles everytime
2018-03-05 13:50:35	josevalim	wojtekmach: why? development convenience?
2018-03-05 13:51:00	-->	mbuf (~Shakthi@49.207.48.226) has joined #elixir-lang
2018-03-05 13:51:17	wojtekmach	yes, convenience
2018-03-05 13:51:20	josevalim	if you have compile.parsers it means people depending on your lib still needs it
2018-03-05 13:51:49	wojtekmach	it's an alias it's private to my package
2018-03-05 13:52:17	josevalim	i think we use aliases still?
2018-03-05 13:52:20	wojtekmach	oh wait, if I do `compilers: [:thing | Mix.compilers]` then others would need that too, huh?
2018-03-05 13:52:27	josevalim	wojtekmach: yes, exactly
2018-03-05 13:52:38	josevalim	wojtekmach: may we still need to do something to make this workflow better
2018-03-05 13:53:08	wojtekmach	I suppose I can have `compilers: compilers(Mix.env)`
2018-03-05 13:53:32	josevalim	wojtekmach: but then you don't have precise control when the last version is generated
2018-03-05 13:54:01	josevalim	if you forget mix compile before release you get different output
2018-03-05 13:54:34	wojtekmach	right
2018-03-05 13:54:46	josevalim	wojtekmach: maybe do an alias
2018-03-05 13:54:51	josevalim	compile.dev that does both
2018-03-05 13:54:52	josevalim	i dunno
2018-03-05 13:56:03	wojtekmach	right, I suppose I could alias `hex.publish` to make sure it's compiled before release too. I don't really have that problem yet, will keep an eye on it though
2018-03-05 14:00:19	josevalim	wojtekmach: better a check that it is out of date compared to the original file

2018-03-05 14:05:03	josevalim	wojtekmach: the other issue is that we rely on private functions a lot on the combinators
2018-03-05 14:05:09	josevalim	and when you move the combinator around they don't work anymore
2018-03-05 14:05:16	josevalim	unless you also move the private functions
2018-03-05 14:05:21	josevalim	so you do need to have everything in a single place
2018-03-05 14:08:45	wojtekmach	josevalim: re timestamp check, do you mean to add that  to nimble_parsec.compile or to my project's flow?
2018-03-05 14:09:41	josevalim	wojtekmach: to your project flow
2018-03-05 14:09:47	wojtekmach	yup
2018-03-05 14:11:08	josevalim	wojtekmach: i am not sure how to best solve this :(
2018-03-05 14:12:35	josevalim	wojtekmach: actually, I have one
2018-03-05 14:12:36	wojtekmach	I think a good enough solution is to have `compilers: compilers(Mix.env)` and running tests before releasing the package

However the phoenix logs  show me that the app is starting each 2 minutes.  The daemon.log systemd gives me systemd[1]: ...-phoenix.service: Failed with result 'timeout'. any ideas what might be wrong?
2018-03-05 16:20:33	LordPraslea	The app works but sometimes i get error 502 from nginx(possibly when it's restarting)

2018-03-05 17:11:01	LordPraslea	antranigv,  The simplest way to do this is to run your app on anothe rport and forward it to a proxy/load balancer of choice (nginx, haproxy, apache..)
2018-03-05 17:12:27	antranigv	LordPraslea: will that 1) effect on the performance much? 2) Elixir/Phoenix to be able to see real user IP other than 127.0.0.1; I assume the former with the help of headers.
2018-03-05 17:12:31	LordPraslea	Or you can use the setcap function if it exists on freebsd and allow elixir/iex/mix

2018-03-05 17:13:04	LordPraslea	Well I just deployed my first phoenix app saturday and fixed some issues for it today and i'm using nginx + phoenix .. and I see the headers..
2018-03-05 17:13:06	antranigv	I'll try now tho.
2018-03-05 17:13:15	LordPraslea	There are probably some performance issues since you don't serve directly
2018-03-05 17:13:19	LordPraslea	But think of it this way
2018-03-05 17:13:27	LordPraslea	On 1 server you will have multiple apps (phoenix/elixir)..
2018-03-05 17:14:00	LordPraslea	They can't all run on port 80/443 but you can have 1 proxy/http server and multiple subservers that each run on separate ports that communicate withthe proxy
2018-03-05 17:14:14	LordPraslea	This way you can have an app for each (sub)domain
2018-03-05 17:14:25	tristan__	fishcakez: ericmj how does postgrex know when to reload types? does it rely on the row description and check it against what it knows, or is here some othr way i can trigger a reload
2018-03-05 17:14:48	antranigv	well, we only have one web server, the rest are OTP, so no issues there, altho who knows later on. + I run every service in a VM.
2018-03-05 17:15:06	fishcakez	tristan__: I think released versions reload on connection and use row description
2018-03-05 17:15:21	LordPraslea	And another more important aspect.. when you run elixir/phoenix with distilery or exrm it gets run as a node, and erlang nodes have some security issues when put directly to the internet, so it's best to have it in a separate vm that communicates to the proxy

2018-03-05 17:22:21	fishcakez	tristan__: you mean it reads 4 bytes (or however many it is) and then reads the rest using that length?
2018-03-05 17:22:25	tristan__	and the epgsql client uses active,true...
2018-03-05 17:22:29	tristan__	fishcakez: yea
2018-03-05 17:22:37	fishcakez	that'll be slow for many rows
2018-03-05 17:23:49	tristan__	basically, <Code:8/integer, Size:32/integer>> = recv(Sock, ?MESSAGE_HEADER_SIZE)
2018-03-05 17:23:55	tristan__	then read Size-4
2018-03-05 17:25:03	tristan__	found it interesting that epgsql uses active,true. since maybe in a case like this it works out, since serer should only respond with the data you want and stop anyway, not flood the process unexpectedly
2018-03-05 17:25:58	fishcakez	yes its likely ok i think, if you cant trust your own postgresql deployment, what can you trust?

2018-03-05 17:34:04	fishcakez	tristan__: do you need to type reloading to do that?
2018-03-05 17:34:41	tristan__	I thougth so?
2018-03-05 17:34:54	tristan__	to know the name of the enum type

2018-03-05 17:36:30	tristan__	yea
2018-03-05 17:36:50	fishcakez	enums are just text over the wire so I assumed it would work to send text oid, but then to receive rows you'd need to know to convert text -> atom

2018-03-06 09:09:42	inoas	How to use phx.gen.html to create a radio input with 3 enum vlaues or a select dropdown with 3 values or even a multiple select box with 3 values? Currently I got mix phx.gen.html Account User users name age:integer desc:text date_of_birth:date published_at:naive_datetime admin:boolean
2018-03-06 09:10:58	benwilson512	inoas: I think you just need to write the html
2018-03-06 09:11:07	benwilson512	I don't think you can have the generator create that
2018-03-06 09:12:06	inoas	so there is no form helper for select, select multiple (via select and via radio / multiple checkboxes)?
2018-03-06 09:12:34	inoas	I am looking to make sure the std generator output looks good... that's why I am asking @ https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/pull/2785
2018-03-06 09:13:27	benwilson512	there is a form helper, I just don't think the generator ever creates it

2018-03-06 09:18:22	inoas	how would I add a field to the schema - by running  phx.gen.html ? Is there a data type for enum or would it be a string?

2018-03-06 09:34:40	benwilson512	inoas: you can use ecto_enum for enum data types but I don't think there's a generator thing, nor are there generators for adding fields. generators bootstrap the project, after that it's normal coding
2018-03-06 09:35:41	inoas	What confuses me is that it seems that phx.gen.html generates not only view templates and controllers but also schema information?
2018-03-06 09:35:51	inoas	despite that the generator is called something with html
2018-03-06 09:36:34	benwilson512	inoas: it says so in the help for that task "Generates controller, views, and context for an HTML resource."

2018-03-06 09:36:54	benwilson512	all the generators are named after basically the maximal thing they generate

2018-03-06 16:59:48	hakunin	In many ways I understand why we should build the basic implementation, then as a separate step wrap it in some OTP concept (genservers, other actors), and I understand why this also should apply to something like Ecto - there is no reason to couple something to a specific way of persistence. However, in practice building something decoupled from Ecto, then adding Ecto support is very hard to design.
2018-03-06 17:01:08	hakunin	We could use a bit more writing on the latter.

2018-03-06 17:05:10	hakunin	For example, let's say you're writing a library and you want to allow library users to inject their own functions for some querying of data. Using elixir-level functions is very inefficient when dealing with querying a db.

2018-03-06 17:06:34	hakunin	I bet everyone ran into that at some point - base implementation is so clean, then you add ecto persistence and realize you need to allow injection at the very surface level to allow for efficient querying.

2018-03-06 17:42:13	hakunin	a @behavior for a library like that would basically have every UI function declared as a callback

2018-03-06 17:42:54	asonge	if you want to do clustering, you have to think about state, netsplits, and failure modes

2018-03-06 18:31:32	tristan__	my guess was asonge was thinking of how erleans you just return the state like your state in a genserver and the persistence part is hidden from the dev writing the genserver type thing

2018-03-06 18:34:38	hakunin	here's an example of my thing: e.g. you want to tell your user: plz write a function that takes a term and determines whether this term is "expired" (by whatever criteria you deem necessary). With that 1 function you can now build 2 functions: "get_fresh_terms" and "get_expired_terms". However, you cannot use that function if terms are stored in db, unless you do filtering in elixir, which is undesirable.
2018-03-06 18:35:08	hakunin	simple things like that are hard to design
2018-03-06 18:35:20	hakunin	and it's nothing to do with elixir in particular quite frankly…

2018-03-06 18:37:03	hakunin	so instead you have to tell your user: you have to implement 2 functions: "get_fresh_terms" and "get_expired_terms" to support another kind of persistence
2018-03-06 18:38:54	hakunin	asonge: does that make any sense? ^ in my 15 year career i never quite found a better way to deal with this…
2018-03-06 18:39:05	asonge	i think so.

2018-03-06 18:41:22	hakunin	so if in principle you just need 1 piece of logic from a user to build 5 query functions, you can't just ask user to give you that 1 piece of logic, instead you need to make user write all 5 query functions because logic is not portable between collections and rdb
2018-03-06 18:44:24	hakunin	it's not the end of the world, but makes me feel bad every time i come across a case like this
2018-03-06 18:44:45	cmk_zzz	hakunin: I've come to the conclusion, that while writing functions like : get_blablah_by_date, get_blahblag_by_id, etc *feels* like you are repeating yourself and you want to abstract that away. But in practice, there are in fact not too many queries like this and you gain a lot by being explicit
2018-03-06 18:45:41	hakunin	i wonder if there is a way to convert elixir functions that operate on lists, and other collections into efficient sql queries

2018-03-06 20:49:52	bobbertson	It's a pretty common task I think just not sure how to do it in phoenix
2018-03-06 20:50:03	bobbertson	I want each User to have his own Room and just 1 room and thats it
2018-03-06 20:50:12	bobbertson	number of users should be == number of rooms
2018-03-06 20:50:17	bobbertson	each user has a room
2018-03-06 20:50:21	bobbertson	each room is owned by a user

2018-03-06 20:51:11	bobbertson	cast_assoc sounds right I'm just confused on how it works

2018-03-06 21:42:49	mmcclure	ah bummer, so this is expected
2018-03-06 21:43:00	benwilson512	mmcclure: yeah, the conn isn't mutable
2018-03-06 21:43:08	benwilson512	or at least the struct bit isn't
2018-03-06 21:43:18	mmcclure	the specific bummer is that it blows away our CORS headers :(
2018-03-06 21:43:40	benwilson512	I mean if it's returning a 500 anyway is that a big issue?
2018-03-06 21:43:40	mmcclure	ok cool, at least we're not doing something wrong
2018-03-06 21:43:53	benwilson512	(I don't write a ton of front end code)
2018-03-06 21:44:20	mmcclure	well for a JSON parse error it's a 400 with a response body
2018-03-06 21:44:40	mmcclure	you're right, 500s aren't as much of an issue
2018-03-06 21:44:49	benwilson512	at which point is the JSOn parse error happening?
2018-03-06 21:44:55	benwilson512	is this Plug.Parsers?
2018-03-06 21:45:15	mmcclure	yep
2018-03-06 21:45:44	benwilson512	hm, I don't recall that raising
2018-03-06 21:45:53	benwilson512	where is your cors plug?
2018-03-06 21:45:59	benwilson512	before or after plug parsers?
2018-03-06 21:46:03	mmcclure	before
2018-03-06 21:47:01	mmcclure	it's before the plug parsers
2018-03-06 21:47:17	benwilson512	hm
2018-03-06 21:47:25	mmcclure	and I validated that the cors plug, but the time the parser plug raises, has already set the resp_headers to include the correct CORS headers
2018-03-06 21:47:39	mmcclure	yeah that's what's throwing us for a little bit of a loop
2018-03-06 21:47:44	benwilson512	I don't recall plug parsers raising
2018-03-06 21:47:54	benwilson512	is this in a phoenix endpoint.ex or in a plug router?
2018-03-06 21:47:56	bobbertson	found a video about nested forms so i will go through it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_Zv_BT1gKI

2018-03-06 21:48:32	mmcclure	our CORS plug is right before the plug parsers
2018-03-06 21:48:41	benwilson512	ok
2018-03-06 21:48:48	mmcclure	the specific raise that's happening is `Plug.Parsers.ParseError`
2018-03-06 21:48:55	mmcclure	for invalid JSON in a POST body
2018-03-06 21:49:12	benwilson512	ah yea
2018-03-06 21:49:13	benwilson512	so it does
2018-03-06 21:49:40	benwilson512	mmcclure: well you could always wrap it I suppose

2018-03-06 21:50:51	benwilson512	I can't say off the top of my head. I mean you could experiment and throw like a `plug :foo` right before the parsers and put something on the assigns there
2018-03-06 21:50:54	benwilson512	but I mean think about it if you do
2018-03-06 21:51:57	mmcclure	we did that to test some stuff, but after it reaches the parsers we kind of lose visibility into what exactly happens

2018-03-06 21:52:52	benwilson512	`x ` is still gonna be `%{}` no matter what foo and bar do
2018-03-06 21:53:04	benwilson512	the `try` that catches the Plug.Parsers exception is way before your cors plug
2018-03-06 21:53:44	mmcclure	right, that makes sense
2018-03-06 21:53:58	mmcclure	and is kind of why we're confused by this functionality
2018-03-06 21:54:09	benwilson512	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/AbM20uEN/
2018-03-06 21:54:15	mmcclure	or are you saying that the `try` that catches has some reference to an older `conn`?
2018-03-06 21:54:22	benwilson512	I'm saying that try has an older conn yes
2018-03-06 21:54:39	mmcclure	ahh that makes sense
2018-03-06 21:54:55	mmcclure	okay, we can head down that path. Thanks!

2018-03-11 02:32:43	benwilson512	every other part of the schema is a pretty ordinary map which can be unquoted or escaped at our leisure, which makes processing then compiling easy. the anonymous functions can't be escaped obviously so I have to basically shove those off to the side

2018-03-11 20:10:14	 *	iFire pokes fishcakez 
2018-03-11 20:10:43	fishcakez	iFire: sup?
2018-03-11 20:10:56	iFire	fishcakez: If the database I'm using doesn't have a drop schema command, do I need to implement it via a sorted parent child table schema + views
2018-03-11 20:11:21	iFire	does anyone else have to do that solution?
2018-03-11 20:11:29	fishcakez	If your database doesn't support, shouldn't fake it but fail
2018-03-11 20:11:48	iFire	thanks
2018-03-11 20:12:07	iFire	So there's an initialization step where it asks for a schema and creates it but fails on the second time
2018-03-11 20:12:26	iFire	so I was wondering where to go. I know I haven't given you enough details
2018-03-11 20:13:20	iFire	fishcakez: Oh since you're here, what's the command to run the ecto tests on the actual database? What do you recommend? I copied the postgresql tests in but that seems shady.
2018-03-11 20:13:42	iFire	You can tell me the command for postgrex.
2018-03-11 20:13:47	iFire	I can translate the command.
2018-03-11 20:14:08	fishcakez	MIX_ENV=pg mix test
2018-03-11 20:14:22	celyr	my insert is failing
2018-03-11 20:14:25	celyr	and i don't get why
2018-03-11 20:15:07	fishcakez	Shouldn't need to copy all tests, just the pg dir in integration tests and point to the dir via deps. See one of the other ecto adapters

2018-03-11 20:16:48	iFire	fishcakez: oh the other question was: the database has schemas, but there's multiple schemas and one global database. The schema is called app and it is the default is nothing is used. For example create table APP.TEST vs create table TEST I believe postgresql has databases and schemas, what approach should be taken?

2018-03-11 20:27:31	iFire	 no such table: main.users
2018-03-11 20:29:12	iFire	celyr: did you define the database table users
2018-03-11 20:29:16	celyr	no
2018-03-11 20:29:21	iFire	your schema says user
2018-03-11 20:29:23	celyr	I did define the schema user
2018-03-11 20:29:39	celyr	yeah and I have no idea of where this userS is coming from
2018-03-11 20:30:01	iFire	can you print the foreign keys on workday

2018-03-11 20:37:46	iFire	right now I can slot the ecto snappydata driver in to the techemprower benchmark but it fails on a lot of edge cases

2018-03-11 20:38:03	iFire	I just want it to work so I can use it for my projects
2018-03-11 20:38:22	celyr	I used the erlang driver for firebird long ago
2018-03-11 20:38:27	celyr	I needed it for production with elixir
2018-03-11 20:38:36	iFire	what happened to it?
2018-03-11 20:38:39	celyr	It doesn't work
2018-03-11 20:39:07	celyr	It just doesn't but it's there and it's even well, used
2018-03-11 20:39:20	celyr	so I guess that if your one works at least a bit will be helpful for many

2018-03-12 13:07:01	benwilson512	aight I'm clearly missing something obvious, how do I use update_all with 1) dynamic column 2) fragments
2018-03-12 13:07:24	benwilson512	doing an update: in the query permits fragments, but I can't figure out how to have it use a dynamic column, it complains about it not being a keyword list
2018-03-12 13:07:40	benwilson512	doing the update in Repo.update_all enables easy custom columns but no fragments

2018-03-12 21:34:16	theWhisper_	everytime i need to update a field in the db like age i have to update the whole struct?
2018-03-12 21:35:02	benwilson512	theWhisper_: you can just not pass in values you don't want to update to the changeset
2018-03-12 21:35:12	theWhisper_	but i am getting errors
2018-03-12 21:35:17	theWhisper_	says name is required
2018-03-12 21:35:32	benwilson512	do you have a validate_required?
2018-03-12 21:35:36	theWhisper_	yes
2018-03-12 21:35:41	benwilson512	is name on that list?
2018-03-12 21:35:46	theWhisper_	yes
2018-03-12 21:35:49	theWhisper_	in the changelist
2018-03-12 21:35:54	theWhisper_	and in the user struct
2018-03-12 21:36:01	benwilson512	if you don't want to make it required then don't have it on the required list
2018-03-12 21:36:04	theWhisper_	but i only wan to update the email
2018-03-12 21:36:21	benwilson512	that's what I'm saying
2018-03-12 21:36:23	theWhisper_	but i made it required when i was using it for registration
2018-03-12 21:36:27	benwilson512	ah
2018-03-12 21:36:30	benwilson512	make two changeset functions
2018-03-12 21:36:54	theWhisper_	how i make it use the other function?
2018-03-12 21:37:04	theWhisper_	ecto created that schema for me
2018-03-12 21:37:06	benwilson512	you call it instead of the existing one
2018-03-12 21:37:13	benwilson512	you keep the schema, just add another function to that module
2018-03-12 21:37:25	theWhisper_	and how would i call it?
2018-03-12 21:37:32	benwilson512	how do you call the current one?
2018-03-12 21:37:33	theWhisper_	as of now i am using this

2018-03-12 21:38:14	theWhisper_	struct is ofcourse name email age password etc
2018-03-12 21:38:22	benwilson512	cool, so just call Rebel.User.update_email(struct, params)
2018-03-12 21:38:36	benwilson512	where update_email is another function that has changeset logic
2018-03-12 21:38:42	benwilson512	the `def changeset` function isn't special
2018-03-12 21:38:47	theWhisper_	but i will need to create a new changeset then?
2018-03-12 21:38:52	theWhisper_	ohh ok

2018-03-13 13:07:26	zoldar	mix help --names ?
2018-03-13 13:08:03	zoldar	it will lists all tasks and aliases in a single list though

2018-03-13 13:56:57	celyr	what do you do, just put a nginx in front of it ?
2018-03-13 13:57:11	jer	celyr, that's what i've done before
2018-03-13 13:57:18	Uniaika	celyr: of course. I never let my BEAM process run as root
2018-03-13 13:57:23	jer	almost always put things behind load balancers
2018-03-13 13:57:28	jer	be they nginx, HAProxy, etc.
2018-03-13 13:57:32	chrismccord	celyr nginx is commonly used, but you can also port forward directly to another port
2018-03-13 13:57:45	Uniaika	Nginx is a very audited piece of software and I only use that to run on port 80
2018-03-13 13:57:46	chrismccord	celyr : if it's the only thing you're serving off of 80, that's what I do
2018-03-13 13:58:02	celyr	I'll go that way then, thanks
2018-03-13 13:58:21	chrismccord	celyr : so you can serve your phoenix project on say, 8080
2018-03-13 13:59:04	chrismccord	celyr : then port forward 80 to 8080, ie https://serverfault.com/questions/238563/can-i-use-ufw-to-setup-a-port-forward

2018-03-13 14:01:59	asonge	the thing about sticking something in front of phoenix is that if you have long-lived connections, you have to worry about running out of file descriptors or ports
2018-03-13 14:02:08	gazler	You can do something like `sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 4000`
2018-03-13 14:02:26	chrismccord	gazler : that's what I did initially but then I found iptables don't stick around by default

2018-03-13 14:02:54	chrismccord	note: I'm a terrible sysadmin

2018-03-13 14:05:06	celyr	I think there is no chance
2018-03-13 14:06:01	asonge	i think sticking nginx in front is valid, but firewall-level forwards seem to just be even simpler than nginx
2018-03-13 14:06:03	tuacker	with recent linux kernels you can also use CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to allow non-root to bind on low ports IIRC

2018-03-13 18:27:48	benwilson512	unless you're in a wildly tight loop ets is gonna be fast enough
2018-03-13 18:27:50	bbhoss	nothing's wrong with it, I just thought it would be a bit faster as a constant
2018-03-13 18:28:43	benwilson512	you can set a module attribute to the value and then reference the module attribute
2018-03-13 18:28:44	bbhoss	I have a phoenix app just doing some really basic stuff and it's taking a few ms to do anything in production
2018-03-13 18:28:44	benwilson512	calls to ets are low single digit microseconds
2018-03-13 18:28:44	bbhoss	gotcha, well that ain't it
2018-03-13 18:28:56	benwilson512	is that few ms round trip from the browser? or ms as logged by phoenix?
2018-03-13 18:30:10	bbhoss	by phoenix
2018-03-13 18:30:28	benwilson512	do any database access?
2018-03-13 18:30:33	bbhoss	nope
2018-03-13 18:31:00	bbhoss	so I have an authentication plug that just checks some headers. if they aren't what is expected, it sends an empty 400 and halts
2018-03-13 18:31:10	bbhoss	even that is creeping into the ms
2018-03-13 18:31:33	benwilson512	how complex is the auth header check?
2018-03-13 18:31:43	bbhoss	I do have a controller pushing things into GCP PubSub, and that is taking a few dozen ms which is fine. but it's curious that the plug is taking that much time

2018-03-14 15:48:31	dmilith	I wonder why since 20.x until current v20.3 I have this problem with building Elixir - http://s.verknowsys.com/19c6a516486b3be8b762bec6e93f78a7.png
2018-03-14 15:48:49	dmilith	I use exactly the same build options and compiler settings
2018-03-14 15:49:02	dmilith	when I switch to 19.3.. it just works and builds fine
2018-03-14 15:49:30	dmilith	but with OTP 20... it builds only on OSX.. but on HBSD it's not
2018-03-14 15:49:31	dmilith	(freebsd 64 11.1 + hardening)
2018-03-14 15:50:00	dmilith	if anyone have a bit of a clue why that happens.. and how to workaround this.. I'd be grateful so much.
2018-03-14 15:50:03	asonge	dmilith: i'm guessing it might have something to do with precompiled regular expressions not being compatible if there's been some fiddling with the pcre library?
2018-03-14 15:50:21	asonge	(erlang has a private fork of pcre)

2018-03-14 15:50:38	dmilith	each my build process using the same version of libraries.. pcre is 8.40
2018-03-14 15:50:47	asonge	pcre is not the system pcre.
2018-03-14 15:50:49	dmilith	oh, I provide additional one. Interesting
2018-03-14 15:51:02	dmilith	so let's try without my additional pcre :) thanks
2018-03-14 15:51:16	asonge	either that, or something is wrong with rebar...
2018-03-14 15:51:38	dmilith	ah! actually I don't use pcre on my side. Both useful
2018-03-14 15:51:50	dmilith	let's give it a try
2018-03-14 15:52:46	asonge	dmilith: another fix might be seeing what rebar is running (if it's the one cached off by mix or not) and force it to redownload...but i think that's done by default?
2018-03-14 15:53:11	asonge	like, each new elixir version has to download its hex.local and rebar.local...
2018-03-14 15:53:12	dmilith	I guess it's doing make in elixir repo :)
2018-03-14 15:53:28	asonge	ah, right...
2018-03-14 15:53:36	dmilith	it's otp side for sure.
2018-03-14 15:53:48	dmilith	With 19.3 same definition flies with 1.6.3 - no problem

2018-03-14 15:59:45	asonge	can you try to let it use its own?
2018-03-14 16:00:34	asonge	the build process has an automated set of patches that it runs against vanilla PCRE, and I honestly have no idea how robust those patches are...

2018-03-14 16:09:44	dmilith	yea, with additionally provided pcre it crashes ;)
2018-03-14 16:10:33	dmilith	with duplicate symbols, so that's clear that I can't provide pcre myself. But how to decipher this bad_arg on rebar side - is the question
2018-03-14 16:10:57	dmilith	it happens only on OTP > 20.0
2018-03-14 16:11:11	dmilith	any hints much appreciated. A real riddle to solve ;)
2018-03-14 16:11:30	dmilith	riddle: not you, you're unsolvable ;)
2018-03-14 16:12:58	antranigv	dmilith: are you using ZFS on OSX? o.O with beadm?

2018-03-14 16:13:58	dmilith	antranigv: both correct :)
2018-03-14 16:14:14	dmilith	both awesome solutions.
2018-03-14 16:14:26	dmilith	I mean boot environments plus ZFS ;)
2018-03-14 16:14:28	fishcakez	is rebar escriptized on different version of erlang to that is being run?
2018-03-14 16:15:04	fishcakez	Oh but that shouldn't matter as rebar wouldn't store the re binaries in their modules, ignore me :D

2018-03-14 16:18:59	dmilith	with OTP 19.3.5 it just builds fine
2018-03-14 16:19:30	dmilith	antranigv: it is freebsd, just with hardening features like grsecurity for Linux
2018-03-14 16:20:04	antranigv	dmilith: I know HBSD, I have it in front of me. I run Elixir 1.6.1 with OTP 20.x just fine.
2018-03-14 16:20:06	dmilith	codebase and compiler and base os is the same
2018-03-14 16:20:31	dmilith	yea, so I wonder if it's not hardening features / compiler hardening features

2018-03-14 16:21:52	antranigv	dmilith: so OTP20 is making issues

2018-03-14 16:21:59	dmilith	20.3
2018-03-14 16:22:01	dmilith	20.2
2018-03-14 16:22:05	dmilith	and 20.1 for sure
2018-03-14 16:22:25	antranigv	dmilith: if you want I can test today (still waiting for Azure to deploy my stuff so I have some time) on my HBSD
2018-03-14 16:22:26	dmilith	so this is the question about rebar thing
2018-03-14 16:22:54	dmilith	try it. If it works then I will have more info about that it's something on my part.
2018-03-14 16:22:59	dmilith	Would be super useful info.
2018-03-14 16:23:43	antranigv	dmilith: sure, will let you know as soon as I compile.
2018-03-14 16:23:56	dmilith	I know there's rebar3.. maybe it's something wrong / unpatched in build process. No clue
2018-03-14 16:24:01	dmilith	thx!
2018-03-14 16:24:01	antranigv	dmilith: any specific thing? I don't have wx enabled (it's a server)
2018-03-14 16:24:18	dmilith	I use --enable-threads --with-dynamic-trace=dtrace --enable-smp-support --with-ssl=${PREFIX}  --enable-native-libs --without-odbc --without-docs --enable-sctp --enable-kernel-poll
2018-03-14 16:24:25	dmilith	for otp configuration
2018-03-14 16:24:40	dmilith	this makes most performance that I can get from OTP
2018-03-14 16:25:07	dmilith	I'm sure that there are builds without kernel poll or without native-libs... but that's the deal

2018-03-15 16:51:23	benwilson512	Uniaika: when it comes down to the use of a one particular datastructure or another the only thing you can really do here is benchmark
2018-03-15 16:51:37	Uniaika	you're right!
2018-03-15 16:51:40	asonge	in small cases, you can reason about your access patterns
2018-03-15 16:52:00	asonge	but maps are internally sorted tuples when the number of elements is <32
2018-03-15 16:52:01	benwilson512	well I'm not saying that algorithmic analysis is pointless, just that there's a variety of `O(log(n))` options
2018-03-15 16:53:00	Uniaika	I guess it'd be a good use for StreamData & Benchee then?

2018-03-16 10:37:19	asonge	phoenix is almost all plugs...plugs are a *really* simple abstraction
2018-03-16 10:37:31	asonge	you could put a plug function in your router directly, but i think that's probably a bad idea
2018-03-16 10:38:11	asonge	a plug is just a module that has 2 functions, init/1 (transforms options, possibly at compile time) and call/2 (takes a connection and some options, returns a connection)

2018-03-16 14:35:55	jerel	Can somebody here explain how mix aliases work in an umbrella project? I'm using `mix test --no-start` in one app in an umbrella and when running `mix test` at the top level it appears to be started
2018-03-16 14:36:32	critch	Based on your comment, I would be better off potentialy moving that messaging into a genserver or maybe a spawned, named, process. This way a crash wouldn't take down the other pushes.

2018-03-16 15:23:21	pelmen	Hi Guys. I have an opinion question. I am used to deploying apps behind Nginx server (even elixir ones). But for new project, there will be no routing requirements (for different servers/domains), no load balancing requirements really. Should I simplify stack, and use only cowboy ? Site might have high traffic.

2018-03-16 15:29:22	asonge	pelmen: there's security reasons *to* do it, though kinda shaky. basically, erlang was immune from heartbleed.
2018-03-16 15:30:06	pelmen	ha . interesting. Thank you
2018-03-16 15:30:50	pelmen	What I am also thinking about. Nginx is (?) much faster at SSL termination. How will handling SSL in cowboy will affect it's performance ?

2018-03-16 15:31:53	asonge	not much? when whatsapp started terminating ssl in their erlang stack, the number of connections per server went down to 1 million concurrent instead of 3 million
2018-03-16 15:32:18	gamache	pelmen: no security concerns with raw Cowboy that I know of.  SSL termination might be a bit faster in Nginx, but I don't know for sure or how much
2018-03-16 15:32:22	fribmendes_away	josevalim i spent quite some time reading your erlang topology implementation and some questions popped. why do you need an id besides the node name?

2018-03-16 15:32:57	pelmen	hmm interesting. Does cowboy support http2 ?
2018-03-16 15:33:01	asonge	pelmen: i think some of the cost of ssl termination might be amortized if you've got http/2 from end to end (or if you proxy through cloudflare)...most of the cost is in setup
2018-03-16 15:33:15	asonge	cowboy does, phoenix doesn't quite (yet)...it'll be altogether soon.
2018-03-16 15:33:22	asonge	all together*
2018-03-16 15:33:43	pelmen	I usually terminate in nginx, and then ntinx -> cowboy is not SSL, since it's in the same data center
2018-03-16 15:33:44	fribmendes	also, in your latest PR the only way a node can get added to the subscribers map is through the connect/2 and disconnect/2 functions. yet throughout the code there are multiple `send`s to the subscribers. shouldn't these be removed?

2018-03-16 15:35:38	asonge	phoenix is rather stable, and i don't know if the featureset is going to really be expanding
2018-03-16 15:36:15	pelmen	Yeah I am good with "features" per see. But I do like to have better technologies available like http2
2018-03-16 15:37:25	asonge	yeah. though some of the really interesting work there is kinda held off while people think of how to use the new http2 features (and for browsers to expose some of the functionality to javascript)

2018-03-16 15:39:02	pelmen	Well http2 is pretty much handled automatically by browser. Request stapling and other stuff, which in my understanding makes site faster, by not authenticating every request. which I like. What do you mean by "browsers to expose some of the functionality to javascript" ?
2018-03-16 15:39:17	asonge	websocket kinds of functionality
2018-03-16 15:39:26	pelmen	have not used those yet
2018-03-16 15:39:52	asonge	you can kinda get there with push-promises, but the server still has to be "polled"...

2018-03-16 16:07:37	fribmendes	josevalim: makes sense. in your latest PR the only way a node can get added to the subscribers map is through the connect/2 and disconnect/2 functions. yet throughout the code there are multiple `send`s to the subscribers. shouldn't these be removed?

2018-03-16 19:30:59	bobbertson	it doesnt matter its the same concepts
2018-03-16 19:31:20	theWhisper_	what i mean is
2018-03-16 19:31:22	bobbertson	if you mean in the deps you dont see it thats because comeonin changed since the version in book
2018-03-16 19:31:23	theWhisper_	there is no dependency
2018-03-16 19:31:27	bobbertson	rightt
2018-03-16 19:31:27	theWhisper_	like argon or anything
2018-03-16 19:31:36	bobbertson	the dependencies used to be built into comeonin apparently
2018-03-16 19:31:40	bobbertson	now you have to get them seperate
2018-03-16 19:31:44	bobbertson	to make comeonin smaller i imagine
2018-03-16 19:31:46	theWhisper_	ohh i see
2018-03-16 19:32:02	bobbertson	that or they used to be dependencies of comeonin itself
2018-03-16 19:32:16	bobbertson	either way the structure just changed so now you can choose which hashing algorithm to use yourself
2018-03-16 19:32:29	bobbertson	outdated book lol
2018-03-16 19:32:36	bobbertson	book is from 2016

2018-03-16 19:33:24	bobbertson	im going to go through it myself i think
2018-03-16 19:33:40	bobbertson	also old though
2018-03-16 19:34:20	theWhisper_	how you ditch deps?
2018-03-16 19:34:25	theWhisper_	the right way i removed argon

2018-03-18 13:08:39	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. I'm trying to understand Ecto Multi transactions. I believe something is wrong with this transaction I wrote: https://gist.github.com/fschuindt/f3ce9c32c5d407a3106e7e88393752b3 Any tip/clue? Thanks.

2018-03-18 13:12:30	fschuindt	The database is called "payers" actually. May the missing "s" is the issue, I will try to spot it.

2018-03-18 13:13:16	fschuindt	sevenseacat: true, thank you, Sir!

2018-03-18 13:22:30	benwilson512	the issue isn't with `Multi.insert(:payer`
2018-03-18 13:22:40	benwilson512	the table is specified by the schema module

2018-03-18 13:23:49	theWhisper_	well after all the web search
2018-03-18 13:23:56	theWhisper_	i came down to the programming phoenix book
2018-03-18 13:24:06	theWhisper_	best explained for registering and authenticating users
2018-03-18 13:24:08	theWhisper_	awesome
2018-03-18 13:24:46	theWhisper_	i almost gave up there

2018-03-18 13:25:10	theWhisper_	benwilson!!!!
2018-03-18 13:25:14	theWhisper_	do it ill buy it
2018-03-18 13:25:18	fschuindt	theWhisper_: I have it here on paper. Didn't started it yet, all I can say is that it looks pretty. I've only read the Programming Elixir 1.3 by Dave Thomas so far.
2018-03-18 13:25:45	theWhisper_	but thats for elixir per se no?

2018-03-18 13:29:27	fschuindt	tristan__: what's up?

2018-03-18 13:30:27	tristan__	fschuindt: nothing :), just good to see grpc getting usage in elixir world
2018-03-18 13:31:31	fschuindt	theWhisper_: is a Google implementation of remote protocol calls using Google Protocol Buffers. Which is kinda a way to connect with your server in a optimized, business specific way.

Like 20 years ago everyone was using IDE cables for data wich is parallel. Then they picked a slower interface and made it faster, which is SATA. Then they turned back to parallel with those M.2 NVMe PCIe interfaces. I mean, SOAP was good, just like

2018-03-18 18:20:53	kapil___	fschuindt:  is gRPC can be used as alternative to graphql?
2018-03-18 18:22:19	fschuindt	kapil___: sure. but it's a completely different thing. I think the goal with graphql is make easy to query, and gRPC is to optimize. But they do generate client libs for many languages, so it's in some sense "easy" to query. But not as GraphQL.
2018-03-18 18:22:37	fschuindt	I think that gRPC is more to uService stuff
2018-03-18 18:22:55	fschuindt	and GraphQL to full blown web apps, like JSONAPI
2018-03-18 18:23:16	kapil___	thanks
2018-03-18 18:23:33	fschuindt	you are welcome :)
2018-03-18 18:24:06	kapil___	i have a full blown web app. i am using graphql. should i use graphql or grpc?
2018-03-18 18:26:05	fschuindt	kapil___: that's a choice for you. I mean, try to watch some talks on the both. I personally think that GraphQL and Jsonapi is good when you want to provide public APIs and stuff. gRPC feels more message passing between different endpoints of your stack and grid.

2018-03-19 19:06:04	benwilson512	as I understand it the very notion of a release is bound up with being comipled
2018-03-19 19:06:43	cmk_zzz_	the-kenny: we've got a small docker build machine for each platform we support which builds the releases for the various platforms and includes the erts.

2018-03-19 19:07:52	the-kenny	cmk_zzz_: Yes, I thought of that too. This, or just building an archive in a Docker and shipping the Docker image itself. Too much hassle for me, but surely a nice way of doing things when stuff gets bigger.

2018-03-20 03:05:05	stiang	I can’t find anything in the Phoenix docs about leaving a channel. is it not possible, or doesn’t it make sense? my use case is that joining a certain channel turns on a feed of messages that can be pretty intense, and it’s important to stop sending these messages when clients leave that part of the app.
2018-03-20 03:06:08	sevenseacat	you can unsubscribe from channels right?
2018-03-20 03:07:18	stiang	sevenseacat: I would think so, but how? maybe I’m blind, but I can’t find it in the docs.
2018-03-20 03:10:41	stiang	I did find this, but it seems pretty dated: https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/358 I can’t find the "leave" function he speaks of in the source.

2018-03-20 03:13:18	sevenseacat	the tests look like they have a leave function https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/assets/test/channel_test.js#L920
2018-03-20 03:14:10	sevenseacat	ie. channel.leave() on the js side

2018-03-20 03:17:08	stiang	oh, I hadn’t seen that. thanks! looks very promising.
2018-03-20 03:19:08	stiang	... and I am blind. it’s documented right here, a page I have looked at quite a bit the last few hours: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/js/
2018-03-20 03:19:57	stiang	but it was collapsed and not mentioned in the examples. that will be my official excuse for missing it.
2018-03-20 03:20:29	sevenseacat	I didn't see that either so, not just you :D

2018-03-20 20:30:15	benwilson512	ah yeah
2018-03-20 20:30:54	quazimodo	I'm a bit confused, I've created a generic 'docker-dev-env' that has some nice things for developing, and i works well for a couple elixir apps that we have. But on a newly installed app it's failing with  'Could not find "rebar3", which is needed to build dependency :ranch'
2018-03-20 20:31:01	quazimodo	is this in newer versions of phoenix?
2018-03-20 20:32:54	quazimodo	nvm stupid question i'll just go check out dependencies for phoenix and see what's up with ranch
2018-03-20 20:33:48	quazimodo	no, not stupid question, both the working app and the failing one are running ranch 1.3.2
2018-03-20 20:34:32	benwilson512	mix local.rebar
2018-03-20 20:34:52	quazimodo	could it be that in the docker environment there is no rebar3, but there is on my local machine and that when I installed the working apps originally it was in my machine's native env that had rebar3, now that it's compiled everything runs in the docker env since it doesn't need to get rebar3
2018-03-20 20:35:20	quazimodo	benwilson512: yeah i'll have to rebuild the docker dev env to have rebar3
2018-03-20 20:35:36	quazimodo	just super curious why some apps don't complan and some od

2018-03-24 23:00:42	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. I have two apps inside a Umbrella: database and iugu_publisher. My iugu_publisher app wants to use the Ecto.Repo defined inside the database OTP app as: Database.Repos.Payments. I tried using "Elixir." prefix, but I'm getting compilation errors about those modules being not available. Is possible to access another's app namespace form a umbrella environment? Any clue?
2018-03-24 23:09:45	asonge	fschuindt: one app needs to be a dependency of the other to access the modules there
2018-03-24 23:10:12	asonge	there's an in_umbrella: true param, iirc
2018-03-24 23:10:49	fschuindt	asonge: nice! I have used only extra_applications in mix.exs. Isn't enough, right?
2018-03-24 23:11:16	asonge	fschuindt: dependencies are declared in deps(), and those deps() are auto-included in extra_applications.
2018-03-24 23:11:30	fschuindt	asonge: got it, thank you, sir!

2018-03-25 22:45:14	fishcakez	nisstyre: there is a way to do it by fetching the code from the beam file, getting the debug info, turning that into elixir, formatting quoted expression to string using Macro but think it'll be easier to just read the source on github as Im not aware of straightforward way to do it.maybe there is though...
2018-03-25 22:45:38	nisstyre	fishcakez: fair enough!
2018-03-25 22:46:02	nisstyre	fishcakez: it would be cool if someone made a plugin for vim or something that could do online expansion of Elixir code
2018-03-25 22:46:07	nisstyre	Racket has something like that I think for macros
2018-03-25 22:46:52	fishcakez	nisstyre: well the way to do what I said is like 4 function calls but tricky to remember the exact calls :)
2018-03-25 22:47:03	fishcakez	time you typed it out github could be open :D
2018-03-25 22:47:08	nisstyre	yeah of course
2018-03-25 22:47:15	fishcakez	Maybe the elixir language server has something for this
2018-03-25 22:47:21	nisstyre	what is that?
2018-03-25 22:47:40	fishcakez	https://github.com/JakeBecker/elixir-ls
2018-03-25 22:48:10	nisstyre	this reminds me of SLIME kind of
2018-03-25 22:48:59	nisstyre	anyway, sounds cool, I'll check it out
2018-03-25 22:49:03	nisstyre	thanks for the info
2018-03-25 22:49:55	fishcakez	hopefully someone is working on integrating it into vim 🤞

2018-03-26 00:53:57	jer	yes
2018-03-26 00:54:53	hakunin	tuple2 = {tuple1} # if I understand correctly that tuples are stored literally as complete adjacent chunks of memory, then there is no guarantee that the outer tuple has space to "wrap" the inner tuple where it's sitting
2018-03-26 00:56:25	hakunin	so must be copy, meaning that if you have 2 tuples, 1-element, and 2-element, then inserting former into latter is as slow as combining them with {t1, t2}
2018-03-26 00:59:59	jer	hakunin, one thing you could do to confirm, is write a little erlang to contrive some tuples like you're talking about, and erlc -S and see what that outputs
2018-03-26 01:02:07	hakunin	jer: that sounds awesome (just checked what -S does), might try it later, thanks

2018-06-05 04:38:53	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. I know that's not specific to Elixir, but I'm trying to fix a bug in my Elixir code with it. Why does 1000 - 10.07 equals 989.93 but 1000 - 100.07 equals 899.9300000000001?

2018-06-05 04:46:21	fschuindt	Then sometimes this pops up. I started debugging and came accross this odd result.

2018-06-21 20:27:43	fschuindt	Hi there folks. I'm trying to implement the 'def' macro in Elixir with macros. I'm really a newbie and I'm kinda lost here. Any tips? https://gist.github.com/fschuindt/7b96a10c385612895fc60cda58491664 Thanks!

2018-06-21 20:32:58	benwilson512	ehhh the built in one isn't super easy to read tbh
2018-06-21 20:33:17	hauleth	and if you use `bind_quoted` then you cannot use `unquote` https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#quote/2
2018-06-21 20:33:20	benwilson512	and it dispatches to the erlang based elixir_def module pretty quick
2018-06-21 20:33:29	hauleth	benwilson512: it isn't that hard
2018-06-21 20:34:27	fschuindt	hauleth: thank you! You're right, I think unquote_splicing will help me out.

2018-08-16 17:45:20	ariedler	it would also allow you to annotate other parts with different docs if you decided to split up the macro

2018-08-16 17:49:08	josevalim	otherwise i would have made `@doc` be a list of binaries and metadata, as an accumulate attribute
2018-08-16 17:50:14	josevalim	although I think the generalization of this would either be to allow custom code to be invoked when an attribute is set
2018-08-16 17:50:41	hauleth	josevalim: yeah, that would be on one hand strange on other expected.  I do not know which is worse.  However I would <3 to see some way to have access to that data without such hacks
2018-08-16 17:50:48	josevalim	which then means `@foo :bar` could not store anything on `@foo` at all

2018-08-16 18:02:15	hypercore	josevalim, what's webpack 4 performance like in phoenix 1.4?
2018-08-16 18:02:29	josevalim	no idea, try it out :)
2018-08-16 18:03:03	hypercore	josevalim: from master branch?
2018-08-16 18:03:21	josevalim	hypercore: yes, i think in the README or installer/README there are instructions to run from master
2018-08-16 18:03:29	josevalim	but you can also just try webpack 4 outside of phoenix
2018-08-16 18:03:32	josevalim	it should be the same performance
2018-08-16 18:03:38	josevalim	phoenix doesn't change anything
2018-08-16 18:04:08	hypercore	josevalim: that's the reason i ask, in anticipation of phoenix 1.4 i thought i would familiarize myself with webpack, however the hot reloading seemed really slow
2018-08-16 18:04:26	hypercore	brunch seems way quicker when chaning css files for exapmle
2018-08-16 18:04:26	josevalim	hypercore: we bypass webpack reloading though, since phoenix has its own
2018-08-16 18:04:38	chrismccord	hypercore : we don't worry about HMR in webpack so not related
2018-08-16 18:04:52	hypercore	oh ok, great to hear
2018-08-16 18:05:03	chrismccord	our code reloader watches the compiled app.js and app.css for changes and either refreshes the page or re-applies the css
2018-08-16 18:05:05	chrismccord	nothing more
2018-08-16 18:05:28	chrismccord	you can of course use webpacks hot reload with wahtever their instructions are, but not something we do out of the box for you
2018-08-16 18:05:35	hypercore	got you, i assumed it would be using webpack's reloading featuresr
2018-08-16 18:05:57	chrismccord	nope, we are js lib agnostic
2018-08-16 18:06:01	hypercore	phoenix's reloader seems way faster, definitely sticking with that
2018-08-16 18:07:50	hypercore	also, when do you guys anticipate phoenix will optimize its deployment code?
2018-08-16 18:08:04	hypercore	is that planned for v2?
2018-08-16 18:08:49	chrismccord	hypercore phoenix will never be part of the elixir deployment story
2018-08-16 18:09:09	hypercore	oh
2018-08-16 18:09:11	chrismccord	so follow the efforts on the distillery side if you are interested in elixir deployment tooling
2018-08-16 18:09:23	chrismccord	which phoenix of course works with, just like any other elixir application

2018-08-16 18:20:40	hypercore	chrismccord: just to clarify, do you still plan on deprecating distillery after merging it into mix?

2018-08-16 18:22:08	josevalim	the @deprecated attribute is not the same thing as the metadata
2018-08-16 18:22:31	hauleth	josevalim: but :since or :deprecated in @doc will not work
2018-08-16 18:22:34	josevalim	and __struct__/1 is private, so none of the metadata matters anyway
2018-08-16 18:22:44	asonge	hypercore: on what? the config problem (which is a few barely related problems that require a lot of thought to resolve all of them together) or the self-extracting/self-executing tarball thing?
2018-08-16 18:22:45	josevalim	private in the sense you don't call it directly

2018-08-16 19:01:56	Sentreen	Context: I'm dividing some work over a cluster. At the moment execution time is dominated by message sending (which is to be expected)
2018-08-16 19:02:26	Sentreen	However, when I add new nodes, the program takes significantly longer to finish, even though I send the same data around. (data is sent to a random node for processing)

2018-08-16 19:03:38	Sentreen	I get why it becomes slower when I need to send data over the network, but I cannot see how adding more potential nodes to process the same amount of data makes my application noticeably slower.
