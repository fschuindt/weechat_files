2017-02-01 11:13:23	stamourv	bremner: Yeah, still using 1st edition too. I kind of like using explicit substitution as a stepping stone, though. Will need to read over 2nd, to decide whether to upgrade.

2017-02-01 12:16:57	bremner	depends what you mean by LISP I guess. If your primary goal is to learn Common Lisp, the obvious thing to do is to learn that.
2017-02-01 12:17:34	bremner	if you mean the whole family of lisp-like languages (including scheme) then racket is a reasonable place to start.
2017-02-01 12:20:09	pi-	I'm working with Julia, which uses its own flavour of LISP to parse syntax
2017-02-01 12:20:47	pi-	'FemtoLisp'
2017-02-01 12:21:42	pi-	I'm choosing Racket as the tutorial is nice and visual, and will help me get my head around the LISP way of thinking.
2017-02-01 12:22:21	profmakx	though not entirely clear which bit of that you need to use julia?
2017-02-01 12:22:30	pi-	Just slightly concerned that it might start diverging from FemtoLisp
2017-02-01 12:22:58	pi-	It's really to help me understand how Julia works under the hood.
2017-02-01 12:23:16	pi-	As a simple Julia user, one would never see this machinery.

2017-02-01 17:29:02	pseudonymous	soegaard: I tried compiling my toy racket webserver as you suggested yesterday (when I was asking whether there were any obvious optimisations I might look into) - turns out, compiling racket code doesn't actually lead to a speed benefit. The program is (possibly) loaded a bit faster, but it runs the same.
2017-02-01 17:30:26	soegaard	pseudonymous: True - it's the loading times that improves.
2017-02-01 17:31:25	pseudonymous	btw - noting your nationality - do we have any places in Denmark where racket is spoken of ? Meetups or the like ?
2017-02-01 17:31:41	soegaard	If one accidently gets Racket installed without compiling the standard libraries, then you will see a big difference.
