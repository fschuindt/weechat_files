2018-03-26 00:21:16	fschuindt	Folks, I recently installed Fedora 27 on my brand new desktop. But the onboard ethernet isn't working on it. Works just fine on other OS. My ethernet controlle is a Intel I219-V. As Fedors 27 comes with the kernel 4.13 and this issue suggests upgrading it: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1525523 I upgraded to the kernel 4.15.10 but the error persists. My ethernet keeps "connecting", nothing
2018-03-26 00:21:16	fschuindt	happens then it shut down. Any help?

2018-08-02 14:12:33	bugs_	one last thought - cpu c states and irqbalance
2018-08-02 14:13:05	bugs_	there are potential problems with idle cpu's being put into suspend low power mode
2018-08-02 14:13:20	bugs_	and irqbalance assigning an important IRQ (like the intel graphics) to
2018-08-02 14:13:27	bugs_	a sleeping cpu
2018-08-02 14:13:40	Demos	hmmm
2018-08-02 14:13:45	Demos	how does this interact with NUMA
2018-08-02 14:13:56	nekocentral	idk
2018-08-02 14:14:08	nekocentral	its CPU#5 that is stuck everytime
2018-08-02 14:14:26	Demos	I guess you don't typically care about power usage as much with big NUMA systems
2018-08-02 14:15:15	bugs_	now wait a minute if you actually disabled hyperthreading there can't
2018-08-02 14:15:17	bugs_	be a cpu #5
2018-08-02 14:15:59	nekocentral	with it on its 5, with it off its 2
2018-08-02 14:16:23	nekocentral	let me try sometime
2018-08-02 14:16:49	bugs_	oh ok wew scary
2018-08-02 14:17:41	bugs_	so another thing to try is to disable intel c states in bios, blacklist the intel c state module, and recompile a new irqbalance
2018-08-02 14:18:12	bugs_	i am not sure the latest irqbalance (which fixes a bunch of this) is in
2018-08-02 14:18:14	bugs_	your fedora yet
2018-08-02 14:18:21	nekocentral	i just tried to disable nouvou
2018-08-02 14:18:27	nekocentral	its the respin
2018-08-02 14:18:30	bugs_	now that is always worth doing (rofl)
2018-08-02 14:18:55	nekocentral	with that disabled it just uses nvidia drivers right?
2018-08-02 14:19:09	nekocentral	it got the nvidia card working but cpu still here
2018-08-02 14:19:29	bugs_	i don't think nvidia proprietary drivers will install at all if it detect nouveau

2018-08-02 14:19:52	bugs_	lsmod | grep nvidia
