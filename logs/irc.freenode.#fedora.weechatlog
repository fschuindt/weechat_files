2018-03-26 00:21:16	fschuindt	Folks, I recently installed Fedora 27 on my brand new desktop. But the onboard ethernet isn't working on it. Works just fine on other OS. My ethernet controlle is a Intel I219-V. As Fedors 27 comes with the kernel 4.13 and this issue suggests upgrading it: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1525523 I upgraded to the kernel 4.15.10 but the error persists. My ethernet keeps "connecting", nothing
2018-03-26 00:21:16	fschuindt	happens then it shut down. Any help?
