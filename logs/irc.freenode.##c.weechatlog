2018-06-19 09:18:09	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. Given this picture of a math formula: https://s30.postimg.cc/ndks6gohd/fib_formula.jpg I'm wondering which numerical type should I use when performing the aritmetic. Any tip?
2018-06-19 09:18:26	azarus	fschuindt: double
2018-06-19 09:18:40	fschuindt	azarus: not long double?
2018-06-19 09:19:08	azarus	depends, on my platform they're the same size
2018-06-19 09:19:32	fschuindt	azarus: huum, thank you. I'm really a noob in C stuff.
2018-06-19 09:20:11	fschuindt	there's any known/good Decimal implementation like in other languages?
2018-06-19 09:20:15	azarus	fschuindt: no problem. in c, data types depend heavily on the architecture you're developing for
2018-06-19 09:20:35	azarus	do you mean arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic?
2018-06-19 09:20:52	azarus	for that, GMP, libtommath, libzahl and such are good
2018-06-19 09:21:11	fschuindt	azarus: I'm going to run it in x86 only. Yes. Nice, I will take a look. Thank you, sir!
2018-06-19 09:21:21	dp	I haven't looked at libzahl since its early days, how's it doing?
2018-06-19 09:21:30	azarus	ah. but keep in mind; x86 != x86_64
2018-06-19 09:21:47	azarus	fschuindt: you're welcome
2018-06-19 09:21:52	fschuindt	azarus: huum, good. yea, it's x86_64. thanks! :)
2018-06-19 09:23:04	dp	Oh right zahl still only does integer arithmetic

2018-06-19 09:24:13	azarus	dp: yup
2018-06-19 09:24:22	dp	That's good I guess
2018-06-19 09:24:29	azarus	didn't remember correctly /o\
2018-06-19 09:24:39	fschuindt	Anything but IEEE 754 please :x
2018-06-19 09:24:45	dp	Oh, it's in the name, of course!
2018-06-19 09:25:01	azarus	dp: hm? zahl = number
2018-06-19 09:25:02	dp	ℤ comes from German zahlen
2018-06-19 09:25:03	azarus	in german
2018-06-19 09:25:21	dp	and ℤ is the set of all integers in mathematics
2018-06-19 09:25:31	azarus	ah! now it makes sense
2018-06-19 09:25:50	dp	https://git.suckless.org/libzahl/tree/README#n5
2018-06-19 09:25:52	@candide	Title of dp's link: README - libzahl - big integer library

2018-06-19 09:27:19	fschuindt	I took it from a math book I was writing last year
2018-06-19 09:28:40	dp	We used 𝕀 for imaginary iirc
2018-06-19 09:28:48	dp	Wait, no. ℂ
2018-06-19 09:28:50	 *	othias is transcendented
2018-06-19 09:29:02	dp	Off-topic, but How is iℝ different from ℂ
2018-06-19 09:29:30	 *	azarus is afraid of advanced maths, and advanced maths in C -.-
2018-06-19 09:29:47	dp	Closest I got was doing mandelbrot fractals in C

2018-06-19 10:16:13	@candide	That is not a C issue. This channel exists for discussion of the Standard C Language itself; not tools such as Makefiles, IDEs, compilers (see ##workingset for these things) or random libraries (including OS-specific ones such as POSIX or Windows; see ##posix or #winapi).
