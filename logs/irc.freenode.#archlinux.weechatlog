2017-12-09 13:19:31	andrewSC	So a question and a comment.. The question: Should the AUR only contain packages that are generalizable(spelling?) to the distribution. That is, a manjaro etc specific package should not exist in the aur? Second, if so, how should/could that be worded to update the wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Rules_of_submission

2017-12-09 13:25:40	physkets	"The main difference between hardware decoding and software decoding is that in software decoding the file will be decompressed and then moved onto the video card whereas with hardware decoding it will be moved to the video card first and then decompressed. In either case, video playback will still be hardware accelerated via the video card."
2017-12-09 13:26:18	physkets	So in reality, what effect does performing the 'decompression' in GPU, have?

2017-12-09 17:37:13	MacGyver	Kernels have regressions.
2017-12-09 17:37:25	MacGyver	If the old one boots but the current one doesn't, that's a bug.
2017-12-09 17:37:30	ilmostro	also, I see you have "part_msdos" as well as "part_gpt".  I don't think that has to do with this problem, but at the same time, grub generates additional configuration options based on both disk table types.  It may not be necessary, unless you need multiple disks and are doing multiboot

2017-12-09 18:15:12	TotemFallico	Hello guys. Small question: I have a double screen setup and my second screen (which is actually a tv) has a resolution of 1080i (whatever that means) @ 30hz. WHenever i try to set it up at that resolution, the screen is completely black and doesn't show anything, but everything looks fine from xrandr. If i set it to a lower res, the image is larger than the actual borders. Do you have any ideas?
2017-12-09 18:15:18	grawity	the design kinda seems to be specifically local-only

I completed installing/enabling network manager, polkit, and I have "lxpolkit &" line before "exec i3" in my ~/.xinitrc file. If I use nmtui however, it connects to my wlan without prompting for password like I had expected. Why is this? Is this normal behavior? Perhaps I am understanding the wiki wrong.....

2017-12-09 19:45:58	BrandonArnold	Hi all. I'm not sure where to troubleshoot this. I used xset to set my EnergyStar options on this laptop monitor. Anwyay sometimes when the screen turns off and I move my mouse to turn it back on, the sync goes haywire. Even if I switch to the TTY non-X console. It fixes itself eventually when I close some windows in X session (i3 window manager)

But in any case, i have to remind you that every image gives out the option to decide which bootloader to use, so i don't think you can enforce the use of systemd-boot unless you create an installing script that does that

2017-12-09 20:22:54	nixpulvis	UEFI was designed to replace BIOS, so in many ways it's the "future".
2017-12-09 20:23:19	nixpulvis	though TBH, UEFI drives me nuts.
2017-12-09 20:23:32	alasi	Does ext4 on an SSD reduce its lifespan/battery significantly if journaling is enabled compared to btrfs
2017-12-09 20:23:43	MrElendig	most of the uefi issues are the shoddy implementations

2017-12-09 20:26:48	earnestly	nixpulvis: That said, if the system is offering UEFI, it is *very* unlikely that using CSM is actually usin a real BIOS but rather emulation, at which point you're just as complicated as UEFI and more

2017-12-09 20:28:53	BrandonArnold	MrElendig: The de-facto top Google doc on UEFI I read some time back said the spec leaves a lot of freedom to the firmware engineers.

2017-12-09 21:07:43	guys	lol this bug
2017-12-09 21:07:50	earnestly	guys: So the choice is between three aspects: 1) Pretend everything is C, POSIX shortopts and BSD.  2) Use hacks and semi-semantic annotations which is quite ugly.  3) Stick with man which remains consistent and nakedly simple.
2017-12-09 21:07:56	aphirst	ilmostro, nah the only thing that happened on -p3 for the entire night before the reboot was a load of failed ssh connections

2017-12-09 21:08:40	Namarrgon	aphirst: if e.g. the kernel panics or something else happens that prevents journald to sync the logs to the disk then you won't find anything relevant in the logs
2017-12-09 21:08:44	earnestly	grawity: mem does have the fortunate rule that attempting to read the first byte always returns an I/O error
2017-12-09 21:08:44	grawity	earnestly: so dumping core requires knowing which areas are mapped (from /proc/*/maps) and seeking to those first
2017-12-09 21:08:56	nixpulvis	Namarrgon: but the man page for mkinitcpio's -k flag says it only works for x86...
2017-12-09 21:08:59	BrandonArnold	TotemFallico: I mean. I am hearing that wayland is the coming de facto and is just a matter of time, and is such as it is, better than Xorg

2018-01-25 16:30:57	h4rd3n3D	I've been using cryptsetup to encrypt partitions for many years, without issue.
2018-01-25 16:30:57	h4rd3n3D	However, today, using the latest (Jan) gpg verified arch install.iso, when I run:  'cryptsetup -c aes-xts-plain64 -h sha512sum -s 512 --use-random luksFormat /dev/sda12 Arch' I only get (after typing the uppercase YES to confirm the overwrite):
2018-01-25 16:30:57	h4rd3n3D	Failed to open key file.
2018-01-25 16:30:58	h4rd3n3D	I cannot find any useful solution on-line, including the cryptsetup FAQ.  Has anyone else seen this, or know how to correct it?
2018-01-25 16:31:04	MacGyver	See whether the driver entry has an "unbind" file in its /sys tree.

2018-01-25 16:31:23	aphirst	ayekat, fair enough, though that still begs the question of how this focus stealing is even happening
2018-01-25 16:31:27	MacGyver	If so, echo the card's identifier into that unbind file.
2018-01-25 16:31:28	fatalis	mr_sm1th: and you ran mkinitcpio? whats the output of dmesg | grep vfio
2018-01-25 16:31:29	aphirst	since not everyone seems to experience it
2018-01-25 16:31:42	mr_sm1th	fatalis: yes. no output.
2018-01-25 16:31:55	MacGyver	If that works, you should not have any problem simply attaching the card to the VM.
2018-01-25 16:32:23	MacGyver	(But ideally vfio-pci is loaded properly and early enough)

2018-01-25 18:23:57	sekhmet	I suppose in the end that's more the reason why nothing's supplanted tar.  Tar had the historical legacy to keep it in common use, when any intended replacements just fragmented the user base enough that none of them ever gained supremacy
