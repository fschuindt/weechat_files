2017-02-15 16:26:15	fschuindt	I have merged master in a working branch and introduced some changes after it. How can I remove the merge commit from my branch and keep the changes? I've changed different files from those merged.

2017-02-15 16:28:38	jmesmon	fschuindt: you can use git rebase with some arguments (depending on your setup) to remove the merge.
2017-02-15 16:29:28	salamanderrake	can you see an difference here that would cause git to refuse to switch branches?
