2017-12-12 14:20:07	endre	i specified urxvt to be 80x25 when non floating. it goes to 80x25 by itself when i toggle it from tiled to floating
2017-12-12 14:20:49	ralpheeee	ahhh cool ...will try that
2017-12-12 14:23:04	kjetilho	printf '\e[8;25;80t'
2017-12-12 14:23:12	kjetilho	man -s 7 urxvt has lots of tips
2017-12-12 14:23:22	ralpheeee	thxs!

2017-12-12 14:24:47	ralpheeee	kjetilho: that's pretty dope...didnt know about that
2017-12-12 14:25:19	kjetilho	but I wonder - how do I actually use the report escape sequences?
2017-12-12 14:27:25	endre	urxvt is best
2017-12-12 14:27:34	endre	only iterm2 is better in terms of features
2017-12-12 14:27:40	kjetilho	I mean, I can do printf '\e[18t'; read -s foo   - but I have to press Return myself
2017-12-12 14:28:02	kjetilho	but I guess I should ask in #rxvt-unicode instead :)
2017-12-12 14:32:45	endre	what would you like to achieve?
2017-12-12 14:35:07	 *	rouji had nothing but troubles with proper font rendering in urxvt :(

2017-12-12 17:58:51	art-solopov	Hello. I have a problem regarding dmenu/rofi. I tried all the recipes I found (replaced the basic dmenu with j4-dmenu-desktop with rofi as a dmenu display) but it still takes about a second to launch rofi.
2017-12-12 17:59:17	art-solopov	I launched rofi "bare" once and it still took around 1 second to launch.

2017-12-12 17:59:50	fschuindt	just a dumb question, I've faced similar issues, are you using SSD as main storage?
2017-12-12 18:00:17	art-solopov	Yes.
2017-12-12 18:00:25	art-solopov	All my programs are currently on SSD.
2017-12-12 18:00:42	fschuindt	hm, that's odd, I have the same issue with rofi, but I thought it was related with my HDD
2017-12-12 18:00:44	art-solopov	That's why I'm so baffled, even KDE's runner gave me better results.
2017-12-12 18:01:15	art-solopov	And it's not quite related to rofi either, bare j4-dmenu-desktop takes slightly less time but it's not nearly instantaneous.
