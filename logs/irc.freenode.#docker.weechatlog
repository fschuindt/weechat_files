2018-06-08 06:24:29	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. I'm trying to fetch "http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org" from a container and it just times out. But in my host it fetches with no problem. It's a Fedora host. Any clue? Thanks.
2018-06-08 06:25:46	fschuindt	Other addresses seems to work just fine.

2018-07-02 14:01:57	fschuindt	Hello there, folks. Currently on my Fedora host, building a Alpine image it hangs during the fetching the APK index for installing Git. It runs ok if I stop the firewalld service. I've added Docker services to the firewall, as well the ports. But the problem persists. I can wget/curl some URLs but others just fails. Probably something related to DNS. Any clue? Thanks;
