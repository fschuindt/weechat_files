2018-04-06 17:40:33	fschuindt	Hi there, folks. I'm trying to set up a wallet here (I'm running on Fedora, which ATM lacks a distro package) and I noticed when I start my wallet, I also start mining. Is that right? How can I toggle the mining off and just run the regular wallet here? Any tips? Thanks!
