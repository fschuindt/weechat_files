2017-04-19 01:31:13	+OnlineCop	Okay, so there are a few optimizations here: 1) rearrange your   line (.*)  |  line (.*), col (.*)   so the   'line(.*), col(.*)' comes first.
2017-04-19 01:31:25	re101-bobcat-103	I need the column to be either skipped, or match in a group and whenever the group doesn't match return 0.
2017-04-19 01:31:31	+OnlineCop	You want to first try for the thing WITH the comma, if it exists, and then if it doesn't, fall back to the other one.
2017-04-19 01:31:57	+OnlineCop	The best way for that is to use a non-capture group around that stuff, and throw a   ?   after it to make the group optional. Example:
2017-04-19 01:32:24	+OnlineCop	line ([^(),]*)(?:, col ([^()]*)?

2017-04-19 01:37:03	+OnlineCop	And what do you want to do if there is no '(' and '):' ?
2017-04-19 01:39:31	re101-bobcat-103	Yeah in some cases there is just a error message, without any line or columns, It shouldn't match at all, it should skip that line
2017-04-19 01:40:55	re101-bobcat-103	[^...] is basically making sure it doesn't match these characters right?

2017-04-19 01:50:58	+OnlineCop	My first guess will be escaping the  \  characters properly.
2017-04-19 01:51:09	+OnlineCop	Open 'code generator' on the left of the regex101 page.
2017-04-19 01:51:17	+OnlineCop	On, say, PHP, it will escape all the  \  characters for you.
2017-04-19 01:51:25	re101-bobcat-103	I did, it's working only it's just matching one line
2017-04-19 01:51:27	+OnlineCop	I usually copy THAT into VS.
2017-04-19 01:51:48	+OnlineCop	I know Visual Studio uses .NET as its regex engine instead of PCRE.
2017-04-19 01:51:54	+OnlineCop	Do you know whether VS Code does as well?
2017-04-19 01:52:01	+OnlineCop	I'd assume so if it's a Microsoft construct.
2017-04-19 01:53:01	+OnlineCop	It only matches the first line, or it matches several lines down, but stops after it has matched once, and doesn't match any furthr?

2017-04-19 02:01:56	+OnlineCop	Hey re101-gopher-687! The one we implemented for the regex101 site is the old PCRE.

2017-04-19 02:02:45	+OnlineCop	When we add in a new language (PCRE2, .NET, Java, etc.) we actually have to do it very carefully, and all of it is programmatic that we can translate into Javascript.
2017-04-19 02:03:11	+OnlineCop	We made the regex101 site 99% offline-able, so you can load the regex101 page and disconnect from the internet and still have everything "just work" in your local browser.
2017-04-19 02:03:32	+OnlineCop	So when we get a good PCRE2 library that we can compile into Javascript, we'll add that in.
2017-04-19 02:04:21	+OnlineCop	For GoLang, as an example, we found EMSCRIPTEN which let us compile the .c (or .cpp file) as a JS library, which was kind of a task all by itself.

2017-04-19 02:22:29	+OnlineCop	Usually in the browser's console, it will give some kind of feedback as far as the error code, and we can use that to know what's causing the problem.
2017-04-19 02:22:50	+OnlineCop	There's also an issue with timeouts, where a regex tries for too long and finally stops because it couldn't find a match in a set amount of time.
2017-04-19 02:23:03	+OnlineCop	You can adjust THAT from the settings on the page. I think default is 2 seconds before it times out.
2017-04-19 02:23:22	+OnlineCop	Longer-running ones can be bumped up if you know that something _should_ match but that it may just take longer than usual.

2017-04-19 02:28:09	+OnlineCop	Are you trying to deal with a lot of recursion? A lot of backreferences?
2017-04-19 02:28:26	re101-bobcat-103	recursion still blows my mind
2017-04-19 02:28:27	+OnlineCop	Use it as something like a JSON parser where it has to deal with nested constructs?

The_at dogs_nn2 were_vbdr barking_vvg ._.   The regex looks for 1st-person singular subjects followed by an uninflected verb: They_pphs2 demanded_vvd that_cst he_pphs1 resign_vv0. etc.  But there are tons of patterns where the same 2-tag sequence occurs without the construc
2017-04-19 02:38:25	+OnlineCop	Your text cut off after "...occurs without the construc"
2017-04-19 02:38:25	re101-gopher-687	the negative lookaheads start from as far as 10 words to the left of the uninflected verb, and reject part-of-speech sequences that can under no circumstances be subjunctive constructions, before allowing the search to advance.
2017-04-19 02:40:18	re101-gopher-687	not much was missed. There are lots of irrelevant patterns which match the requirement "3rd person singular noun/pronoun followed by an uninflected verb" so the negative lookaheads check for those before allowing the search to continue.

2017-04-19 03:08:08	scriptso	 Http or https... or none,  it would contain mp4, flv, web, m3u... etc but the link contains any of the mention but also .jpeg or png then it should not match.

But $$0 throws it off as it parses the $  and then blows up when it tries to parse the digit and finds another '$' in its place. Or if it encounters a \$1 and the  $  should actually display as a '$' followed by a '1' (like "That costs $1.")

2017-04-19 10:18:37	digitok	* = 0 or more, + = 1 or more, ? = 0 or 1

2017-04-19 10:18:39	+genio	quantifiers work on the thing directly to the left of them.   a   is one singular a.   a+   is one or more a     a*   is zero or more a
2017-04-19 10:18:42	digitok	you can use any of those

2017-04-29 15:11:44	+OnlineCop	Night_: Notepad++ supports  \K  which is a match-reset flag. You can match the <Directory...> that you want to strip stuff out of, and then use \K to reset the match to where you are currently. Then you can match all the <File Name=[^>]*>\s* that you encounter after that.

2017-04-29 15:43:32	fschuindt	Folks, I am a regex newbie, just want to be sure my new regex is valid: /max-age=([0-9])+/g to match the max-age in: "public, max-age=19302, must-revalidate, no-transform". I have tested it online, but any recommendations? There's a way to return the value number instead of "max-age=19302"?
2017-04-29 15:43:54	+OnlineCop	Javascript?
2017-04-29 15:43:58	fschuindt	Ruby

2018-03-20 06:21:58	digitok	:p
2018-03-20 06:22:07	digitok	then remove it
2018-03-20 06:22:08	purplex88	i want to match any substring
2018-03-20 06:22:15	purplex88	remove $ too?
2018-03-20 06:22:29	digitok	unless you only want it to match at the end of a line

2018-03-20 06:23:06	digitok	you probably want to use \b otherwise it's gonna match inside larger numbers

2018-03-20 06:23:39	purplex88	in test string window
2018-03-20 06:23:39	digitok	odd and even
2018-03-20 06:23:49	digitok	so you can easily tell where one starts and one ends
2018-03-20 06:24:52	purplex88	ok specifically i want to match all citations in pdf
2018-03-20 06:25:04	purplex88	e.g. [1].. [454] so on
2018-03-20 06:25:15	digitok	ok so include literal \[ and \]
2018-03-20 06:25:19	digitok	even better
2018-03-20 06:25:23	purplex88	so i guess i dont want boundary
2018-03-20 06:25:34	digitok	a boundary would match there
2018-03-20 06:25:43	digitok	but if you know it's always [] you can use that
2018-03-20 06:25:44	purplex88	[ and ] will define boundary 
2018-03-20 06:27:12	purplex88	https://regex101.com/r/Uu3DBa/3
2018-03-20 06:27:37	digitok	looks good
2018-03-20 06:28:22	digitok	just remove the '?:' if you want to capture the number itself without the brackets
2018-03-20 06:29:34	purplex88	interesting
2018-03-20 06:29:48	purplex88	i don't know the differene between capture and match yet
2018-03-20 06:30:09	purplex88	i guess i only a match
2018-03-20 06:30:13	purplex88	want^
2018-03-20 06:30:20	digitok	match is what is matched by the entire pattern, capture is the parts inside that you want to "extract" individually
2018-03-20 06:30:29	digitok	so currently the regex matches [123]
2018-03-20 06:30:36	digitok	but you could capture just the "123" part
2018-03-20 06:30:39	digitok	into a group
2018-03-20 06:30:54	purplex88	what can i do with capture?
2018-03-20 06:31:12	digitok	you can use it in a replacement or reference it in your programming language
2018-03-20 06:31:53	digitok	say you had a regex that matches the text "Hi, my name is <...>." you could use something like /^Hi, my name is (\w+)\.$
2018-03-20 06:32:04	digitok	so the regex matches the entire string, but you capture just the name
2018-03-20 06:33:28	purplex88	so right now with ?: i capture and match the entire string?
2018-03-20 06:33:51	digitok	you're only matching a substring of [...] including the brackets
2018-03-20 06:34:08	digitok	removing the ?: from the group (currently a "non-capturing group") means that number inside is captured into group #1
2018-03-20 06:34:23	purplex88	i just want use for finding stuff
2018-03-20 06:34:28	purplex88	to^
2018-03-20 06:34:31	digitok	sure
2018-03-20 06:34:38	digitok	it just depends how you plan to use it
2018-03-20 06:34:43	digitok	whether you want to keep the [] or not
2018-03-20 06:34:53	purplex88	so guess i don't need a capture
2018-03-20 06:34:56	digitok	:)
2018-03-20 06:35:13	purplex88	i'm not sure yet what it is anyway haha
2018-03-20 06:35:17	digitok	like if you planned to make a list of the numbers
2018-03-20 06:35:18	purplex88	one question again why do we need odd and even highlight colors?
2018-03-20 06:35:20	digitok	you might want
2018-03-20 06:35:24	digitok	List of numbers: 1, 2, 3
2018-03-20 06:35:28	digitok	instead of
2018-03-20 06:35:33	digitok	List of numbers: [1], [2], [3]
2018-03-20 06:35:41	digitok	so it's easier if you don't capture the [] part
2018-03-20 06:36:00	digitok	it's just so it's easier, visually, to tell where each match starts and ends
2018-03-20 06:36:08	digitok	(the colours)
2018-03-20 06:36:38	purplex88	oh i see now
2018-03-20 06:37:04	purplex88	i thought it meant odd and even length of match
2018-03-20 06:37:37	digitok	ah, heh
2018-03-20 06:41:29	+jaytea	Doqnach, you can solve your issue by changing the inner group from (?:\4|:\b|\]) to (?:\4|:\b|(?=\])) (so the ']' isn't consumed) then move the '\]' from the end to outside that last group

2018-03-20 09:23:14	digitok	the code provided should in theory yield the same result as you see on the site
2018-03-20 09:24:14	re101-walrus-541	@digitok, yes but it doesn't
2018-03-20 09:24:29	re101-walrus-541	probably perl version?
2018-03-20 09:24:32	digitok	i think you're trying to get all of those returned separately but in 1 single match
2018-03-20 09:24:41	digitok	but instead you're gettnig 4 matches
2018-03-20 09:24:43	digitok	right?
2018-03-20 09:24:59	re101-walrus-541	I need ALL matches (in an array)
2018-03-20 09:25:31	digitok	right so for your example you want 1 match with 6 groups in the result
2018-03-20 09:25:44	digitok	instead of 4 matches with 2 groups in the first, and 1 in each of the others
2018-03-20 09:25:56	digitok	3 in the first*
2018-03-20 09:26:23	digitok	that's not really possible unless you know how many there can be at most
2018-03-20 09:26:38	digitok	or grab them all as 1 result and then do a secondary split or regex on that
2018-03-20 09:27:29	re101-walrus-541	ok, thank you, as it is "code" I can arrange for a double match (or split)

2018-03-20 09:35:13	re101-walrus-541	thus is it impossible to match ALL strings following another match?

2018-03-20 09:40:19	digitok	it's possible but ugly if you are willing to set a maximum number of values

2018-03-20 09:40:56	digitok	repeating the last part as many times as you like

2018-03-20 09:44:45	digitok	and then you'd repeat (?:,\s*([^,]+))?over and over to allow more

2018-03-20 11:02:05	+Ouims	. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
2018-03-20 11:03:00	jollygood2	jaytea yeah the remaining 5% is fugly with fnmatch. like not supporting | (so I "solved" that by splitting the pattern at |). also there's no \d{N} in fnmatch, you have to repeat [0-9] N times
2018-03-20 11:04:06	jollygood2	I'm sure I'll be hit by its other limitation as I go. fnmatch is very basic, just supporting * ? and []
2018-03-20 11:06:47	jollygood2	maybe it would be best to have two kind of patterns in config file - straight string match, and full blown regex.

2018-08-07 15:22:38	+Ouims	problem is the website is quick to throw catastrophic backtracking at you
2018-08-07 15:22:56	+Ouims	while what you're doing is ok, just very slow
2018-08-07 15:23:08	fschuindt	Can someone understand this? https://regexr.com/3tjq0 A coworker sent me this regex but all tools say it's wrong. Am I doing something wrong or the regex is wrong itself? Thanks.
2018-08-07 15:23:52	+rewt	there's a mix of double and single escapes in there
2018-08-07 15:25:21	fschuindt	rewt: You mean the `\w`? Are you able to figure out what it's suposed to be instead?
2018-08-07 15:26:13	+rewt	probably \\w+
2018-08-07 15:26:53	fschuindt	rewt: I've tried it, but it complains about "invalid target for quantifier '?'"

2018-08-07 15:37:03	+rewt	you can remove all of "-mix" and that single space in the middle, and it will be identical
2018-08-07 15:37:13	+rewt	m is pointless because there is no ^ or $
2018-08-07 15:37:20	+rewt	i is pointless because there are only digits
2018-08-07 15:37:35	+rewt	x is the only one that does anything, and that is to ignore that single space in the middle
2018-08-07 15:37:56	fschuindt	I believe it's something close to the "(79) 99392-0403" string, those are Brazilian numbers"
2018-08-07 15:38:12	+rewt	i'm talking about the regex, not the target string
2018-08-07 15:38:42	fschuindt	I know, 'cause you mentioned "only digits", (, ) and - does not counts?
2018-08-07 15:39:51	+rewt	yeah, same thing... there's no upper and lower case versions of those to for i to ignore the case
