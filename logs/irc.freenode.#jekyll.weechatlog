2017-01-31 15:36:51	parkr	:wave:
2017-01-31 15:36:56	misty	hi all. I filed a bug on this but wanted to ask here too (the talk.jekyllrb.com seems to be down). I'm trying to add the Kramdown TOC to every page on my site, and it is not working as the Jekyll and Kramdown docs lead me to believe it should. I'm honestly not sure if the problem is Jekyll or Kramdown. I filed a Github issue in each project (Kramdown: https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/406, Jekyll: https://github.com/jekyll/j
2017-01-31 15:37:34	misty	If I manually use the Kramdown macro directly in a Markdown file it works, but trying to get it on every page using the page layout template is not working for me
2017-01-31 15:37:56	parkr	misty: if you move it out of an `include`, does it work then?
2017-01-31 15:38:04	parkr	move it into the layout/page directly
2017-01-31 15:38:12	parkr	you can't `include` markdown
2017-01-31 15:40:32	misty	oh really!
2017-01-31 15:40:42	misty	Let me try that, that will be amazing if that's all it is
2017-01-31 15:42:01	misty	Is it true that the whole thing needs to hug the left-hand margin (no indenting)?
2017-01-31 15:44:15	misty	No, it still isn't working. Let me amend my commit and amend the bugs to state that I tried this.

2017-01-31 15:55:37	parkr	misty: TOC's do work with kramdown, but the caveat is that all content you want to be in the TOC must be in that converter call (i.e. in the same page). http://www.seanbuscay.com/blog/jekyll-toc-markdown/

2017-01-31 15:58:18	misty	parkr: I think I do meet that criteria now that I put it directly in the layout
2017-01-31 15:58:43	parkr	misty: layouts & includes are HTML-only. Markdown goes in a markdown file, like a post/page/collection document.
2017-01-31 15:58:52	parkr	that might be the problem
2017-01-31 15:59:16	misty	oh, I thought the whole point of the markdown="1" was to enable parsing of markdown in HTML 
2017-01-31 15:59:43	misty	The macro does work if I insert it manually into every page, but I was trying to use the layouts so that wouldn't be necessary
2017-01-31 16:00:46	allejo	wonder if markdownify would trigger toc

2017-01-31 16:04:18	misty	well the Kramdown team just responded that it works as expected when using Kramdown directly, so I guess the limitation is either in Jekyll or Liquid
2017-01-31 16:13:26	misty	allejo: I'm not familiar with markdownify
2017-01-31 16:18:56	jaybe	./learn toc is http://www.seanbuscay.com/blog/jekyll-toc-markdown/
2017-01-31 16:18:56	jekyllrb	The operation succeeded.
2017-01-31 16:20:32	jaybe	misty, `markdownify` is a jekyll liquid function; e.g.  {{ site.data.my.raw.markdown | markdownify }}
2017-01-31 16:21:26	misty	oh, so maybe I should try wrapping the {:toc} that way?

2017-01-31 16:23:15	beingjohnm	I am trying set my page background via a variable to the scss file. It looks like I can only use site variables in css and not page variables? I did a google search and didn't see anything that specifically said this so I wanted to confirm.
2017-01-31 16:24:25	beingjohnm	I can work around this by just setting the background inline in the layout but that is a bit messier
2017-01-31 16:26:54	jaybe	i'd guess site and or [[ datafiles ]]

2017-01-31 16:26:59	misty	allejo: jaybe ok, it looks like it's a challenge to get the curly braces escaped for markdownify

2017-01-31 16:34:43	misty	oh that is wizardry, let me try it
2017-01-31 16:35:01	misty	just tried a recommendation on the GH issue that I need to use a .md extension instead of .html but I think that was a false flag
2017-01-31 16:44:05	misty	allejo: no, it stubbornly produces the same thing as always
2017-01-31 16:44:55	allejo	but 135 seconds later, it worked for me :(
2017-01-31 16:45:23	misty	did you have everything left-aligned? I am trying that now
2017-01-31 16:45:50	allejo	yea, indentation and just pasted in _layouts/docs.html
2017-01-31 16:46:24	misty	if it worked for you then there is something silly I am doing, I will play with it some more
2017-01-31 16:47:05	parkr	you'll need to add `{:toc}` to the top of the markdown files – it won't work in layouts.
2017-01-31 16:47:30	parkr	so `index.md`, `_posts/2017-01-31-my-great-post.md` etc will all need the `{:toc}`
2017-01-31 16:48:17	parkr	it'd be neat to see us do something that allows it in the layout, but for now it needs to be next to the markdown content in the markdown document
2017-01-31 16:49:02	allejo	i updated the gist, that's the docs.html i have under _layouts for me
2017-01-31 16:52:19	misty	thanks, I'm trying replacing mine with yours

2017-09-27 05:22:41	christopf	hi
2017-09-27 05:23:16	christopf	i have twist and maybe missing logic: i generate with jekyll a site on my system which i can then upload to my webspace right?
2017-09-27 05:23:34	christopf	so my space doenst need to fulfill any specific requirements like node.js
2017-09-27 05:23:49	christopf	or do i need full access to my webspace and install jekyll on the server?
2017-09-27 05:29:46	oksushi	christopf: you are correct — you generate static HTML pages with Jekyll on your machine, and then publish those pages to a web server

2017-09-29 16:39:06	mohsen_	Hi, I'm trying to edit edit files of my github pages jekyll website under windows, but when I save them as UTF-8, jekyll on github doesn't recognize YAML format does showing YAML specific syntax as plain html, and when I save them as ANSI, the UTF-8 characters in the files are shown question marks in the browser, what's the solution to this disaster?
2017-09-29 16:39:37	mohsen_	I've already tried my life with a BOM remover tool, but that just didn't work and utf-8 characters are still being shown as "?"

2017-09-29 17:22:45	parsnip	mohsen_: i would think save them as utf-8, not ansi
2017-09-29 17:25:16	mohsen_	parsnip: I tried that with notepad, but no luck, it appears notepad adds some non-standard characters to the beginning of the file when you save them as utf-8, and that character is known as byte order mark(bom)
2017-09-29 17:25:35	parsnip	dont use notepad?
2017-09-29 17:26:01	parsnip	notepad is terrible
2017-09-29 17:26:10	mohsen_	parsnip: yeah I heard np++ can save a file as utf-8 without adding that specific character, and I'm trying my luck with it
2017-09-29 17:26:23	mohsen_	Hope it works
2017-09-29 17:28:19	parsnip	ideally your editor can control encodings, line endings, and give feedback about character under point.
2017-09-29 17:28:40	parsnip	i can do all that with emacs.
2017-09-29 17:28:55	parsnip	iiuc, a hex editor can do that too.
2017-09-29 17:30:27	mohsen_	There's another problem right now, I tried converting the files to non-bom utf-8 encoding using np++, but my git client doesn't consider them as changed, so I can't commit
2017-09-29 17:30:48	mohsen_	Can you believe I'm on this for more than 3 hours!
2017-09-29 17:31:24	mohsen_	Didn't development on Windows could be this much disastrous
2017-09-29 17:31:31	mohsen_	didn't know*
2017-09-29 17:35:59	osfameron	oh god, I'd hate to develop on windows...
2017-09-29 17:36:16	osfameron	although if you're in the .net ecosystem, the IDE tooling and such is supposed to be really good
2017-09-29 17:36:38	osfameron	but I'd feel the lack of unix commands and text editors like I'd lost a hand
2017-09-29 17:37:06	mohsen_	yeah, only for .net. apparently windows doesn't like the user to build software for other platforms on windows, lol 
2017-09-29 17:39:00	jaybe	cygwin may ease things a bit
2017-09-29 17:44:11	osfameron	I use "git bash" on my windows laptop, which is even less than cygwin, but more or less enough to just about not hate it
2017-09-29 17:44:25	osfameron	that + vagrant for doing actual dev gets you going
2017-09-29 17:44:36	osfameron	though I still never really found a terminal emulator that I like :-(
2017-09-29 17:44:54	osfameron	(I used ConEmu, which is almost OK, except for the horrific bugs and crashes)

2017-09-29 17:49:39	mohsen_	The best way to develop without pain on windows is virtualizing a linux distro, it has all the tools you need and you're still on wini
2017-09-29 17:52:09	memo1	hi, iam rendering to html images and links with the {{site.url}} option.  But it dont work with pandoc when i want to reder to pdf. How can i solve this? an option that works in both cases
2017-09-29 17:52:11	osfameron	yeah, but using a linux gui under windows seems like overkill
2017-09-29 17:52:31	parsnip	seems weird for git to not know bytes have changed
2017-09-29 17:52:33	osfameron	(or it would, if windows *had* a decent terminal emulator you could just ssh into your linux distro from...)
2017-09-29 17:53:28	osfameron	memo1: you're using pandoc to do markdown -> pdf?
2017-09-29 17:54:11	osfameron	so I guess the problem is that jekyll is markdown+liquid-template, so you just get "{{site.url}}" displayed as a literal?
2017-09-29 17:54:22	parsnip	check the .tex
2017-09-29 17:54:32	memo1	osfameron: yes
2017-09-29 17:55:16	parsnip	maybe use jinja2
2017-09-29 17:55:42	osfameron	googling for "jekyll pdf" I find e.g. http://peterlu.github.io/2014/08/03/markdown_latex_pdf.html which has a few ways to do it
2017-09-29 17:55:43	jekyllrb	Title: Peter J. Lu - Converting the website to documents (at peterlu.github.io)
2017-09-29 17:55:54	osfameron	there's also some plugins available (again, see the google search - I've not tried them myself)
2017-09-29 17:55:55	memo1	osfameron: when i use the absolut path to the file, the markdown -> html dont work.  So i have to use {{site.url}} but pandoc fails, markdown -> pdf
2017-09-29 17:56:37	osfameron	yeah, I can see the problem.  See if any of the solutions in that article help?
2017-09-29 17:56:50	osfameron	another option could be to transform the generate *html* into pdf?
2017-09-29 17:56:55	parsnip	oh, nm jinja2, i forgot this is ruby lnd
2017-09-29 17:56:59	parsnip	*land
2017-09-29 17:57:41	osfameron	or https://github.com/abeMedia/jekyll-pdf which seems to use `wkhtmltopdf`
2017-09-29 17:57:43	jekyllrb	Title: GitHub - abeMedia/jekyll-pdf: Create PDFs from Jekyll pages & documents. (at github.com)
2017-09-29 17:57:56	memo1	osfameron: ok, i really want to use pandoc. To load image is always necesary the {{site.url}} option?
2017-09-29 17:57:57	osfameron	in fact wkhtmltopdf might work on your generated html too
2017-09-29 17:58:44	osfameron	well, you could use a relative url
2017-09-29 17:59:19	parsnip	maybe jekyll exposes something to fill templates? that's all pandoc does
2017-09-29 17:59:27	osfameron	but the site.url is more flexible (e.g. allows you to deploy your site to  mysite.foo.com OR to foo.com/mysite/ easily
2017-09-29 17:59:36	osfameron	parsnip: yeah, that'd be a nice way of doing it
2017-09-29 17:59:48	osfameron	might be worth seeing if there's a plugin that does that
2017-09-29 18:00:16	osfameron	I've wanted something similar before (and therefore I'm a bit unsure if that's easy to implement, but dunno)
2017-09-29 18:01:09	parsnip	osfameron: xy problem, why do you need pdf version?
2017-09-29 18:01:10	osfameron	memo1: there's also https://github.com/fauno/jekyll-pandoc-multiple-formats
2017-09-29 18:01:12	jekyllrb	Title: GitHub - fauno/jekyll-pandoc-multiple-formats: Use pandoc on jekyll to generate posts in multiple formats (at github.com)
2017-09-29 18:01:27	osfameron	parsnip: well indeed, and why do they want to use pandoc?
2017-09-29 18:01:43	parsnip	 oops
2017-09-29 18:01:53	osfameron	memo1: anyway, I'm sure it can be done, hope some of those links help
2017-09-29 18:02:18	osfameron	but I'd start with *a* way to get what you want, rather than being too worried about which tool does it, personally
2017-09-29 18:02:29	osfameron	anyway, I'm off to bed.  good luck :-)  nn
2017-09-29 18:03:16	memo1	osfameron: ok. Thank you

2017-09-30 14:28:38	somiaj	Hello, I am looking for some help writing a plugin. I have a private directory filled with .pdf files, priv/loc1/foo.pdf, which generate just fine. Some of those files I want a second copy in a public location, loc2/foo.pdf.
2017-09-30 14:30:59	somiaj	The plugin will read a .yml data file in _data and use this to get a list of the files that need to be coppied to a second location. So far I have found https://gist.github.com/blakesmith/449491, which is a generator that I could modify to just copy the files to the second location. My second thought was use Jekyll::StaticFile object, http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mojombo/jekyll/Jekyll/StaticFile, add anot
2017-09-30 14:31:05	somiaj	her object to that class and then let jekyll copy it into the second location via that class.
2017-09-30 14:31:11	somiaj	my main issue is the ruby details to get this to work.

2017-10-01 14:52:26	osfameron	it looks like you might have a mess with your YAML frontmatter?
