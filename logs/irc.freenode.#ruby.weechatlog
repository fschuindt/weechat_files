2017-04-22 16:16:28	andras	at the line in question, this stands: @@max_multipart_length= 128 * 1024 * 1024

2017-04-22 18:26:31	mjora7	I think my choice is going to be governed by whichever has the best learning materials. As of now I've been extremely confused by Express and haven't found any particularly good learning resources.
2017-04-22 18:26:34	apeiros	mjora7: #rubyonrails is probably better for that
2017-04-22 18:26:40	mjora7	apeiros: Thanks.

2017-04-22 18:27:10	mjora7	apeiros: Is Ruby popularly used for stuff other than Rails? The only other application that I am aware is Ruby based is homebrew.
2017-04-22 18:27:31	apeiros	puppet and chef see very widespread use
2017-04-22 18:27:32	havenwood	mjora7: I really enjoy Roda, which is more equivalent to Sinatra rather than Rails. Hanami is also a new, more Rails-like option.
2017-04-22 18:27:34	havenwood	mjora7: Yeah, Ruby is popular for all sorts of thing.
2017-04-22 18:27:38	havenwood	things*
2017-04-22 18:27:44	elomatreb	Metasploit is fairly important software too

2017-04-22 18:28:31	mjora7	That's pretty cool, I had no idea! Any interesting things about the language that I might not be aware of? Like particularly good paradigms/libraries?
2017-04-22 18:29:16	elomatreb	Enumerable (http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html) is something you'll probably miss in most other languages after using Ruby for a while
2017-04-22 18:29:37	wng_z3r0	Hello, I am trying to use metaprogramming to create a few classes in a loop. But something with the lexical scoping is messing things up. My quick example is here: https://repl.it/HV4R/3
2017-04-22 18:29:52	havenwood	mjora7: The stdlib has all sorts of gems, from DRb and its Rinda::Tuplespace for distributed Ruby, or YAML::DBM, a Berkeley DB implementation that serializes values to YAML.
2017-04-22 18:30:04	havenwood	mjora7: Etc, etc.

2017-04-22 18:30:19	wng_z3r0	I understand that `num` has scoping issues, but thought that assigning it to a variable inside the do block would make that local to each block iteration
2017-04-22 18:30:26	havenwood	mjora7: concurrent-ruby and nio4r are good concurrency libraries

2017-04-22 18:31:13	havenwood	mjora7: Rack is the most common tool for webservers. You'll find lots of Rack webservers (like Puma, Unicorn, Passenger, Thin, etc) and Rack adapter frameworks (like Rails, Hanami, Sinatra, Roda, etc).
2017-04-22 18:34:12	Mon_Ouie	wng_z3r0: the problem is the scoping rules for @@variables. In the block that you pass to Class.new, @@variables refer to the same variables as outside that block (i.e. Object's class variables in this case)

2017-04-23 00:13:46	Testerneedhelp	yea
2017-04-23 00:13:46	apeiros	good luck :-p
2017-04-23 00:13:48	Testerneedhelp	haha i shouldve known
2017-04-23 00:13:51	Testerneedhelp	a unix guy told me to use ctrl+d
2017-04-23 00:13:56	Testerneedhelp	well it's odd, ctrl+z seemed to work
2017-04-23 00:14:08	apeiros	no idea about windows, so can't help
2017-04-23 00:14:53	ineb	dont know about it either. if nothing helps, you can use an if statement to check for some arbitrary exit value
2017-04-23 00:15:17	Testerneedhelp	i tried doing that and having them type "end"

2017-04-23 00:16:08	Testerneedhelp	true, good point
2017-04-23 00:16:25	Testerneedhelp	0 is useless in this example but the example asks for any 0 input not to be sorted to either array

2017-04-23 00:16:36	Testerneedhelp	it's odd how ctrl+z seemed to work but only certain times
2017-04-23 00:17:23	Testerneedhelp	what's funny to me is that my book didnt cover this at all
2017-04-23 00:17:29	Testerneedhelp	their example was literally a loop that just goes forever

2017-04-23 00:19:37	Testerneedhelp	i supposed itd have to be numeric here
2017-04-23 00:19:44	Testerneedhelp	do i need to use "threads"? never used them.

2017-04-23 00:26:22	Testerneedhelp	i dont know what the error means, this is the first time ive ever worked with ruby
2017-04-23 00:26:39	PorcoRex	Streams are usually ended by EOF, if I'm not mistaken'

2017-04-23 00:29:05	Testerneedhelp	more questions
2017-04-23 00:29:10	PorcoRex	In any case, I think CTRL+D is the correct way to end a stream (not EOF), unless I'm missing something: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-Transmission_character
2017-04-23 00:29:24	Testerneedhelp	why did they make it while( input = gets.chomp)
2017-04-23 00:29:24	Testerneedhelp	im on windows that's the caveat LOL
2017-04-23 00:29:26	Testerneedhelp	i had mine as gets.to_i
2017-04-23 00:29:39	Testerneedhelp	but that seems redudntant, i changed the to_i to be at where they assign the numbers to positive or negative

2017-04-23 00:31:03	ineb	gets is a method that lets the user enter a line
2017-04-23 00:31:03	PorcoRex	Testerneedhelp, you should be careful with to_i, because it will convert any string into a number. I.e. "asd".to_i  #=> 0
2017-04-23 00:31:03	Testerneedhelp	yea
2017-04-23 00:31:03	Testerneedhelp	im aware of both those things
2017-04-23 00:31:03	ineb	the result is a string that looks like "cyaa\n"
2017-04-23 00:31:03	PorcoRex	You may want to use Integer(string) instead.
2017-04-23 00:31:03	ineb	calling chomp on that string removes the \n
2017-04-23 00:31:03	Testerneedhelp	why would the input need the newline char chopped off?

2017-04-23 00:31:17	ineb	and calling to_i on a string returns an int
2017-04-23 00:31:20	Testerneedhelp	with edits based on the github you linked me, it runs, but it seems to be chopping off the first input
2017-04-23 00:31:34	Testerneedhelp	yea ineb but that's fine, the inputs are all supposed to be integers for this example anyways
2017-04-23 00:32:25	ineb	not for you
2017-04-23 00:32:31	ineb	since you need some special exit value
2017-04-23 00:32:46	ineb	could be a number though
2017-04-23 00:32:47	Testerneedhelp	ah ye, well, that's what I meant about moving the to_i

2017-04-23 00:37:18	Testerneedhelp	it's not just the first apparently

2017-04-23 00:37:29	Testerneedhelp	the second time i tried a list of inputs it cut off two of them and it was sort of arbitrary

2017-04-23 00:38:24	Testerneedhelp	ye
2017-04-23 00:38:39	PorcoRex	So then, you have a range defined like 1...(n - 1).
2017-04-23 00:38:41	Testerneedhelp	same deal
2017-04-23 00:38:44	Testerneedhelp	so
2017-04-23 00:38:47	Testerneedhelp	the range needs to be

2017-04-23 00:39:03	Testerneedhelp	this may be a very dumb mistake

2017-04-23 04:03:04	soulisson	baweaver, ok, so in english it's more correct to say, the value associated to the key?
2017-04-23 04:03:39	baweaver	{a: 1, b: 1}
2017-04-23 04:03:45	baweaver	same value, different key
2017-04-23 04:04:07	baweaver	so the value 1 is associated to both a and b, which is confusing.
2017-04-23 04:04:16	baweaver	a key is unique
2017-04-23 04:04:36	baweaver	Though really I think this veers into slightly pedantic territory.

2017-04-23 21:31:19	Radar	1) use && instead of and. 2) payload should be passed in as a variable, rather than relying on instance state 3) Use ! instead of not 4) you could probably split each check into its own method and kinda "obscure" this domain logic elsewhere... a method called "expired?" would make more sense to me than "@payload['exp'] > Time.now.to_i "
2017-04-23 21:31:54	Radar	maybe "obscure" isn't the right way to think about it. I want to be able to read the method and understand what it's doing. Using these 3 letter vars from the payload isn't helping things
2017-04-23 21:32:16	Radar	It requires domain knowledge of what exp, iat, aut, iss and sub are.
2017-04-23 21:32:16	Radar	I think whoever designed the API wasn't designing it for humans to read.

2017-04-23 21:47:42	Radar	Sometimes I ride into work, which means that I don't get that time to write.

2017-04-24 08:46:06	Cork	is there a clean way to tell JSON to force the encoding or replace invalid characters or something?

2017-04-24 17:34:26	__urux__	I'm 1 year to end school; and I'ld like to study in digital-security (like pentesting or exploit developpement or cryptography) and that's Why i'm intresting in ruby (that almost not the topic of this irc ) but if someone work in this domaine which study should I do and which degrees are avaible for this ?
2017-04-24 17:34:58	__urux__	just ask me if you don't enderstand my english

2017-04-24 17:35:41	ineb	this is a very general question.
2017-04-24 17:35:57	ineb	for example. it strongly depens on where you live
2017-04-24 17:37:41	lagweezle	I would think that C, some assembly, UNIX, networking, all of those are good things to learn for pentesting and exploits. Cryptography means LOOOOOTS of math.

2017-04-24 17:40:49	baweaver	For pen testing, lagweezle is right in general. I would focus a lot more on Networking and Unix internals over just Ruby. C would be relevant but Assembly may be slightly overkill for getting started.

2017-04-25 02:28:00	dminuoso	LACampbell: It's just that the prepackaged versions are not exactly up-to-date, so if you have some dependencies on relatively new packages it means extra work. But it's not a show stopper by any means.

2017-04-25 06:51:12	_bet0n	Is it somehow possible to move part of the string matched by regexp to another position in the same string? The position is not fixed but on it's start there is always "- "
2017-04-25 06:52:37	_bet0n	Example:
2017-04-25 06:52:37	_bet0n	254Z One Two Three - Not Important
2017-04-25 06:52:38	_bet0n	Regexp matches the "254Z"
2017-04-25 06:52:38	_bet0n	And I want to move it so the result will look like:
2017-04-25 06:52:38	_bet0n	One Two Three - 254Z Not Important

2017-04-25 18:03:45	eindoofus	baweaver, looks like Eloquent Ruby is from 2011, is that ok? not sure how much has been added since
2017-04-25 18:04:00	baweaver	Yeah, it's still fine
2017-04-25 18:04:21	baweaver	There are some features added since then, but that book is more for the style of it than the fine details of syntax and new bits
2017-04-25 18:04:37	baweaver	really as long as you're reading against Ruby 2.x+ you'll be fine.

2017-04-26 00:19:11	SemiNus	what is what?
2017-04-26 00:19:13	baweaver	Rails is a gem
2017-04-26 00:19:17	baweaver	Ruby is the language
2017-04-26 00:19:27	SemiNus	gem is a ruby package?
2017-04-26 00:19:40	baweaver	yeah
2017-04-26 00:19:51	SemiNus	why is it "on" Rails then?
2017-04-26 00:20:03	SemiNus	that would be like saying:  "PHP on Wordpress"
2017-04-26 00:20:12	SemiNus	or "Perl on OTRS"

2017-04-26 00:20:47	PorcoRex	Ruby is PHP, Rails is Wordpress.
2017-04-26 00:21:17	SemiNus	json also exists as a gem
2017-04-26 00:21:25	SemiNus	why isn't it "Ruby on json" then?
2017-04-26 00:21:35	SemiNus	I don't get the whole idea
2017-04-26 00:21:42	baweaver	It is though
2017-04-26 00:21:49	baweaver	You mean you don't call it Ruby on JSON?
2017-04-26 00:21:58	SemiNus	yes
2017-04-26 00:21:59	PorcoRex	The full name of the framework is not Rails, but "Ruby on Rails".
2017-04-26 00:22:00	baweaver	We have Ruby on HTTP and Ruby on YAML too

2017-04-26 00:23:20	PorcoRex	SemiNus, Ruby is a stand alone language. Ruby on Rails is a framework.

2017-04-26 00:23:21	baweaver	Ruby
2017-04-26 00:23:35	SemiNus	like Javascript compared to jQuery?

2017-04-26 00:23:47	SemiNus	that makes sense!!!
2017-04-26 00:24:02	PorcoRex	Yes.
2017-04-26 00:24:12	baweaver	So go out and learn Ruby on Ruby
2017-04-26 00:24:16	SemiNus	so I first start off by learning Ruby, and once I know how Ruby works,  I can learn the Framework Ruby on Rails (expecting it will make my life easier)
2017-04-26 00:24:23	SemiNus	thank you all
2017-04-26 00:24:31	baweaver	yep
2017-04-26 00:24:38	SemiNus	sorry for the question, but since I am here already, I kind of got curious
2017-04-26 00:24:49	baweaver	Oh not a problem
2017-04-26 00:26:02	PorcoRex	I think that's a big problem sometimes. I've interviewed people for a role as RoR developers and they are pretty good, until I try to get them to separate the framework from the language. They get it mixed up many times.
2017-04-26 00:26:51	baweaver	If someone does that in an interview I instantly mark them as Junior at best
2017-04-26 00:27:26	SemiNus	isn't the term Junior and Senior hard to separate?
2017-04-26 00:27:48	baweaver	Depends
2017-04-26 00:27:54	SemiNus	at least here in the german speaking part of Europe, everyone considers themself a Senior
2017-04-26 00:27:57	baweaver	In general an experienced dev can tell
2017-04-26 00:28:10	PorcoRex	Yeah, definitely stumbles to square one. But what I'm getting at is that Rails is so ubiquitous on the market that people forget there's a language behind it.

2017-04-26 01:30:39	baweaver	yep
2017-04-26 01:30:52	baweaver	because nested JSON is an Ops constant nightmare

2017-04-26 01:47:23	PorcoRex	baweaver, yes, definitely. Someone mentioned the other day here about the new threading in MRI. Did you have a chance to look into it, and if so, what are your thoughts about it?
2017-04-26 01:47:44	baweaver	Not quite
2017-04-26 01:47:57	baweaver	re: jq - I still need to read more into it
2017-04-26 01:48:10	Nilium	It's disturbingly useful.
2017-04-26 01:48:19	baweaver	I know basics at least
2017-04-26 01:48:23	baweaver	and Ruby has bindings for it

2017-04-26 01:50:01	baweaver	Not incredibly familiar with JRuby
2017-04-26 01:50:21	Nilium	Usually when people mention threading in ruby I think of rubinius
2017-04-26 01:50:57	PorcoRex	baweaver, neither am I, but I think they don't have MRI's GIL in place in their implementation.
2017-04-26 01:51:19	gr33n7007h	nah, it runs on the jvm
2017-04-26 01:52:00	PorcoRex	gr33n7007h, right, but I mean, there is no GIL, so the threads are not limited to one running at any given time.

2017-04-27 18:30:43	evenix	Hey guys I have a very puzzling issue. Me and my coworker are using a docker container with the EXACT same system since its on the docker-container (same ruby version, same script..) when I run the same script he's running I'm getting an error; when he does it works and he gets a 200 response. The puzzling thing is that we have the exact same version of ruby (and system..etc.. and openssl) here a gist with more info https://gist.gith
2017-04-27 18:30:43	evenix	ub.com/richardsondx/4fb4b3503f5ddb28079855c4d6401512 the error seem to be happening when the socket is running readline
2017-04-27 18:31:30	evenix	but the puzzling thing is: why is it working for him with the exact same version of ruby and not for me? (Note: It works for me sometimes when I go into byebug and go through the stacktrace etc.. sometimes the request works and return a succesfull result )

2017-04-27 18:38:15	zenspider	that probably won't even hit logging if it is ECONNRESET, it might not be hitting the stack yet
2017-04-27 18:38:20	jgnagy	well, that error means you got a TCP RST back from the remote end
2017-04-27 18:38:37	jgnagy	or something along the way
2017-04-27 18:39:04	evenix	@jgnagy mmh.. how do you explain that its working with no problem when someone with the exact same image runs it on their computer?
2017-04-27 18:39:19	jgnagy	are they on a different machine?
2017-04-27 18:39:24	jgnagy	maybe a different network
2017-04-27 18:39:27	evenix	yes but we're using docker containers
2017-04-27 18:39:32	zenspider	I'm not sure how docker does networking ... if it is bridged to the host computer, then you need to check the differences between the hosts. I'll assume that the docker containers are exactly the same down to the byte (you should be able to confirm that simply by the sha, right?)
2017-04-27 18:39:49	evenix	on the same wifi
2017-04-27 18:39:49	jgnagy	docker only solves for differences in your local (machine's) environment
2017-04-27 18:40:18	evenix	oh ok so you think that it could be the network*?
2017-04-27 18:40:22	jgnagy	you should be able to run tcpdump on your host machine

2017-04-27 18:41:42	jgnagy	you can watch the packets leaving your machine (and where the RST is coming from)
2017-04-27 18:41:51	jgnagy	that is to compare the responses you're getting
2017-04-27 18:41:58	jgnagy	are you running your requests at the same time?

2017-04-27 18:42:42	evenix	but we tried to make a loop and my loop always fails and his always works

2017-04-27 20:41:53	aedorn	As to what they're doing.. one is a consumer (via Bunny) for RabbitMQ, the rest are kicked off on certain events.. they all go through the same process of creating a network namespace, setting up a MAC-VLAN, creating X amount of interfaces on top of that, creating a bridge, and a virtual pair, plus 2 socat processes

2017-04-27 20:43:12	jgnagy	joining on all the non-main threads should be the event you use to stop
2017-04-27 20:43:25	zenspider	I puke up 10k threads all the time. it isn't join that slows me down at all.
2017-04-27 20:43:59	jgnagy	that said, if you're using 2.4 and relying purely on threads for concurrency and doing things that block for a while, you're not going to get much performance benefit from threading
2017-04-27 20:44:17	zenspider	depends on how they block... if it is just io, then it is basically free

2017-04-27 20:50:48	aedorn	It gets kicked off via the Bunny consumer.. and running the Consumer via blocking (which uses join) or not will have the issue. The same as sleeping on the main thread, doing a loop, etc..

2017-04-29 02:40:03	cerulean	i know the language, and every day is april fools here, but i guess maybe i can share my blog post i made about my rails upgrade i made today .. tho i dont know if this is the place :P *silly happy face*

2017-04-29 02:40:53	cerulean	its a short article
2017-04-29 02:41:10	cerulean	if you use sprockets and wanna switch to webpack it might be kinda useful in addition to the existing docs
2017-04-29 02:41:17	havenwood	cerulean: I saw in #rubyonrails. Rails 5, webapck, rgr.
2017-04-29 02:41:20	cerulean	might be able to use it to update rails/webpacker docs

2017-04-29 02:41:40	havenwood	Always nice to hone Rails docs. Lots and lots of folk use em.
2017-04-29 02:42:51	cerulean	yes, i usually never help (usually meaning never) with docs unless i need them personally. but since this was so hard and lasted 24 hours of upgrade. i decided to talk about what i went through in order to ease the transition for other sites. since there were only about 4-5 blog posts i could find including official docs and i was still relatively lost a long way, especially with weird chrome JS errors at e
2017-04-29 02:42:57	cerulean	very corner. but they can all be conquered with the grail i have delivered there. lol
2017-04-29 02:43:16	cerulean	i went to sleep while my site was STILL down lol, and then had to wake up and keep fixing for a foor 4-5 hours lol
2017-04-29 02:43:25	cerulean	foor=good
2017-04-29 02:44:13	cerulean	i knew it was gonna be too hard and i was too tired and didnt wanna push after a full 12 hour coding spree
2017-04-29 02:44:25	cerulean	never had to do that before
2017-04-29 02:44:44	cerulean	i simply wanted to add webpack quick and deploy something i made to production. didnt work out like that lol

2017-04-29 08:24:03	ljarvis	a tab that's travelling the universe
2017-04-29 08:24:26	xpitr	  <- i mean soft tab? or w/e its called. where people without actual tab key on their keyboards press space twice
2017-04-29 08:24:37	xpitr	and seems to be all to common in ruby libs etc
2017-04-29 08:24:39	ljarvis	so 2 spaces
2017-04-29 08:24:40	j416	you mean two spaces
2017-04-29 08:24:51	ljarvis	but yeah, that's very common in ruby land
2017-04-29 08:24:57	j416	2 spaces seems common in ruby yeah
2017-04-29 08:25:06	ljarvis	but not by pressing space twice
2017-04-29 08:25:15	j416	I indent with 2 spaces when writing ruby
2017-04-29 08:25:21	j416	seems normal
2017-04-29 08:25:24	ljarvis	me too, but i do it by pressing tab
2017-04-29 08:25:27	xpitr	i wanted to start a kickstarter campaign to send those poor coders a keyboard with tab key ...
2017-04-29 08:25:28	j416	nod
2017-04-29 08:25:35	xpitr	oh
2017-04-29 08:25:44	j416	xpitr: it's not about tab key or not
2017-04-29 08:25:48	ljarvis	^
2017-04-29 08:25:54	j416	xpitr: it's about convention
2017-04-29 08:25:58	j416	in ruby land, 2 spaces is common
2017-04-29 08:26:01	xpitr	i know i know. i just hate that convention :p
2017-04-29 08:26:05	j416	in other places, tabs are common
2017-04-29 08:26:09	ljarvis	"people without an actual tab key on their keyboard" -- what kind of devil keyboard is that
2017-04-29 08:26:14	j416	:D
2017-04-29 08:26:19	xpitr	ruby keyboard apparently!
2017-04-29 08:26:26	ljarvis	no, we press tab
2017-04-29 08:26:37	ljarvis	but the editor knows we want 2 spaces
2017-04-29 08:26:41	ljarvis	because we're not monsters
2017-04-29 08:26:53	xpitr	real men use real tabs

2017-04-29 08:27:53	ljarvis	i'll ignore the gender specific comment, but the tabs vs spaces debate is long and unforgiving. Just use what you like and have fun :)
2017-04-29 08:28:29	xpitr	aww man i was hoping to fire some stakes ;)

2017-04-29 08:29:59	xpitr	on the other hand, at least no one is trying to hard-enforce coding style like in golang (even though golang's perfect for me)
2017-04-29 08:31:03	ljarvis	i wouldn't say it's hard-enforced since gofmt is optional. That said, I think having a tool like that is great and would welcome something like that for Ruby (if it was there from the beginning though)
2017-04-29 08:31:32	ljarvis	if such a tool existed, it would undoubtedly remove all of those pesky tabs and replace them with 2 spaces :)
2017-04-29 08:31:38	xpitr	i mean, most editors you'd use will integrate gofmt if you install any go specific plugins, packages and whatnot
2017-04-29 08:31:54	xpitr	so its pretty preeetty enforcing
2017-04-29 08:32:10	ljarvis	fair comment. I think that's good
2017-04-29 08:32:31	ljarvis	to a degree anyway
2017-04-29 08:33:02	ljarvis	Go is the perfect language for it though, imo it's simple and very boring. Very few nuances and almost always 1 way to do something. The opposite to Ruby, really
2017-04-29 08:33:15	j416	^
2017-04-29 08:33:21	elomatreb	rubocop can autoformat, but it allows you specify your own style
2017-04-29 08:33:35	j416	didn't know it could
2017-04-29 08:33:36	j416	cool
2017-04-29 08:33:44	j416	I might use that when I get back to ruby
2017-04-29 08:33:50	j416	s/when/if/
2017-04-29 08:34:06	ljarvis	i've been meaning to build rubycop into our process at work for a long time :-/
2017-04-29 08:36:16	j416	heh
2017-04-29 08:36:17	j416	been there

2017-04-29 08:36:25	j416	I think it's an unwinnable game
2017-04-29 08:36:34	j416	ultimately there will be differing opinions
2017-04-29 08:37:14	ljarvis	that's why i've been putting it off, because i would need to configure it quite a lot. We having a basic coding styleguide at work
2017-04-29 08:37:16	elomatreb	It has a functionality that can generate exceptions for all existing files in a project, so you can start to enforce rules for new code and remove the exceptions as you refactor old stuff
2017-04-29 08:37:24	j416	the style that gofmt uses is externally dictated, I think that's one reason why it works so well
2017-04-29 08:37:47	ljarvis	you can dictate the style though, you just have to faff around with config for a while
2017-04-29 08:37:52	ljarvis	which is.. annoying, but maybe worth it
2017-04-29 08:38:04	j416	that's the issue; _you_ become the dictator
2017-04-29 08:38:38	j416	which might work if you own the project
2017-04-29 08:38:49	j416	otherwise you'll end up with multiple dictators
2017-04-29 08:39:07	ljarvis	maybe that's not such a bad thing when you manage a team of developers though, at least trying to keep the style semi-consistent. Agreeing on that style can still be a democracy

2017-04-29 09:14:39	soanvig	I can set tab size to "4 chars", other guy to "8 chars" (because he uses spaces and doesn't care about tab size), and my tabbed code will look awful on his configuration
2017-04-29 09:15:14	soanvig	See github. They have pretty large tab size set on website.

2017-04-29 09:23:39	Papierkorb	soanvig: That is a misconception about tabs. Tabs do not have this issue, as tabs are only used for indention, not for alignment
2017-04-29 09:25:33	Papierkorb	soanvig: on the other hand, someone decided that "2 spaces" is the perfect case and forced it upon everyone. I also use 2 spaces, but I don't like it.
2017-04-29 09:27:08	soanvig	Papierkorb: I find soft tabs of size 2 perfectly readable, so I don't bother. On the other hand I prefer 4-spaces indent in HTML, due to it's low readability.

2017-04-29 09:28:52	Papierkorb	It will not look badly, as the user chose to set the tabs to equal 8 spaces, or 4 spaces, or whatever. to the user it will look great.

2017-04-29 09:35:12	Papierkorb	You tell your editor that you want to align to 7 spaces. it should notice that when you're in a Hash or so, that you want the next line to be aligned accordingly
2017-04-29 09:35:34	Papierkorb	The typing experience doesn't change at all

2017-04-29 09:36:05	soanvig	The first line however needs to be made by hand.
2017-04-29 09:36:54	Papierkorb	sounds like a configuration thing, almost all editors I tried do that automatically for the first line too
2017-04-29 09:37:07	Papierkorb	just type `{`, hit enter, and it'll auto align

2017-04-29 09:39:02	soanvig	Yup, they do indent `{` thing, but sometimes I want to align blocks of code in unusual way. Then soft tabs works good, because I can "shorten" one of the tabs by one space, in example.

2017-12-20 15:32:39	fschuindt	How can I use Ruby to capture HTTP requests made to my computer in the port 3000, for instance? Like: I want to send Rails a HTTP request and use Ruby outside Rails to get this request too. Is that possible?

2017-12-20 20:53:08	tfitts	I'm wondering if there's a way to have a class  that accepts enumerable methods and calls them on a one of the class methods?  Right now I have a report_list that is just an array of hashes.  I'm trying to convert it to a ReportList class that lets me reload the report and do a few other things.  The report list has an array of what are now Report classes that are similar to the hashes but also have a bit more
2017-12-20 20:53:08	tfitts	functionality.  I'm wondering if I can make it so called ReportList.new.each(&:do_something) can call do something on each of the reports, and also so ReportList.new.first will give me the first Report

2018-01-17 16:16:03	apeiros	you can gsub it: .gsub("\r\n", "\n")
2018-01-17 16:16:15	fschuindt	apeiros: I thought it, was just trying to see any sign of hope
2018-01-17 16:16:38	fschuindt	I'm going for regex
2018-01-17 16:17:14	apeiros	gsub doesn't require a regex ;-)

2018-01-17 16:26:24	lcarlson	i just did a rails new --api and it generated a bunch of things I didn't anticipate
2018-01-17 16:26:33	lcarlson	like, why is it bringing in sprockets?
2018-01-17 16:26:40	lcarlson	I get that I can turn that off

2018-01-17 16:28:03	troydm	apeiros: there is no way to not use copy, coz I need to iterate about 100 per sec
2018-01-17 16:28:08	troydm	?
2018-01-17 16:28:25	lcarlson	troydm, you should be able to .clone without impacting performance terribly?
2018-01-17 16:28:37	lcarlson	have you tried? :)
2018-01-17 16:28:39	apeiros	troydm: maybe rethink your algorithm
2018-01-17 16:28:48	troydm	lcarlson: like clone entire Hash or only keys?

2018-01-17 16:29:10	lcarlson	troydm, just the item you're interested in that block
2018-01-17 16:29:15	apeiros	it's quite likely less expensive to dup the hash than use .keys
2018-01-17 16:29:48	troydm	what's difference between clone and dup?
2018-01-17 16:29:48	apeiros	unless you don't need the value to determine whether the key should be deleted.
2018-01-17 16:30:05	apeiros	clone additionally copies singleton_class and frozen state.
2018-01-17 16:30:33	havenwood	lcarlson: I'd not use Padrino for an API. It's more a webframework on top of Sinatra as far as I recall.
2018-01-17 16:30:37	troydm	apeiros: I need values, values itself are Proc that I call that might remove key from Hash
2018-01-17 16:30:51	lcarlson	havenwood, so straight Sinatra for web services?

2018-01-17 16:31:12	havenwood	lcarlson: What are you doing with the API in particular?
2018-01-17 16:31:15	apeiros	oh, and invokes a different callback (initialize_clone instead of initialize_dup)
2018-01-17 16:31:23	lcarlson	havenwood, thx!
2018-01-17 16:31:38	lcarlson	troydm, ya, it looks like .dup is more perf
2018-01-17 16:31:48	lcarlson	especially if you're not looking to do anything special with its class
2018-01-17 16:31:58	lcarlson	which it sounds like you're not since they're simple hashes
2018-01-17 16:32:03	havenwood	lcarlson: Roda is lovely. It's the same maintainer as the Sequel gem and has a similar plugin system.
2018-01-17 16:32:04	havenwood	lcarlson: You can compose the API framework you need from Roda plugins.
2018-01-17 16:32:18	havenwood	lcarlson: The maintainer of Roda also maintains RodaAuth and the Sequel gem, etc - which are also great for APIs.
2018-01-17 16:32:19	lcarlson	havenwood, it looks pretty nifty!

2018-01-17 18:35:38	havenwood	(You don't see CentOS in dev much I suppose. ;-))
2018-01-17 18:36:27	havenwood	Inside: Alternatively you could use `sudo ruby-install --system --latest` to install 2.5 to /usr/local.
2018-01-17 18:36:55	havenwood	Inside: TL;DR: SCL if prod.
