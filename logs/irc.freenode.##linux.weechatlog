2017-04-19 20:05:14	johnkeates	systemd always loses and people always get angry
2017-04-19 20:05:17	Walex	Upstart works pretty well, too bad the default configuration is backwards and it is still too complicate
2017-04-19 20:05:20	phogg	johnkeates: due to the impact of Ubuntu if he's trying to offer his software on a wide set of installed Linux systems upstart can't be ignored. But it can also be supported with a sysv script, so that's probably good enough.
2017-04-19 20:05:33	johnkeates	upstart can be ignored since ubuntu uses systemd
2017-04-19 20:05:36	Walex	hanetzer: Mir had the enormous advantage of working well with Android GPU drivers.
2017-04-19 20:05:37	johnkeates	and upstart handles initscripts too

2017-04-20 17:57:08	tvm	I've used KDE back in the day, but it was always problematic
2017-04-20 17:57:10	chartreuse	It's the reason I stopped using Gnome for my main desktop environment. I liked my menus, I liked my customization. I don't like being forced to use a theme that takes up way to much vertical space for a giant menu button

2017-04-20 23:00:20	jrcharney	Lady_Aleena, llamapixel: ^C closes an application. Be careful when using it. If you ^Z, you likely have put a process into the background which if you pull it up using the `jobs` command, you'll see them running in the background.  `fg` brings that last background app into the foreground.  To kill a background app, you'll need to use something like `kill -9 $pid` where $pid is the process ID of the app.
2017-04-20 23:00:23	jrcharney	Alternatively, you can just use htop and kill applications that way.

2017-04-21 00:42:12	SporkWitch	jim: the PS3 and PS4 controllers are similar: two analog sticks, accelerometers for motion sensing (pitch, roll, yaw, as well as left/right, up/down, forward/back).  the PS3 controller has 16 digital buttons, the PS4 controller has 18 + a laptop-style touchpad (that is also two of those digital buttons)
2017-04-21 00:42:19	Sonny_Jim	h0m3: I'm not sure about the nitty gritty of it, but there's ways of getting PS3 controllers to work with Android phones
2017-04-21 00:42:21	h0m3	I'd love if they opensource only part of the PS core...

2017-04-21 00:43:37	SporkWitch	h0m3: ps3 and ps4 use standard bluetooth for communications with the controller wirelessly; ps3 turns off the radio and uses the USB cable while charging if the other end is plugged into the PS3, not sure about the PS4 but i think it does too (this is noteworthy and useful, as turning off the radio reduces power draw and allows it to charge faster, while still being usable for gameplay; more

2017-04-21 00:47:00	h0m3	SporkWitch: I really had no clue about the PS3 controller, i think i'll purchase one for testing. The x360 controller has a proprietary wireless protocol and all weird communication API. For instancing, the USB cable doesn't transfer data at all, its 100% for power/charging.
2017-04-21 00:47:04	segadreamcast	it protrudes more
2017-04-21 00:47:05	SporkWitch	naw, the dpad's problem isn't one of material, but physical design.  rather than have distinct segments, it's a single piece, making it more difficult for distinct inputs; this is mostly a disadvantage in fighting games

2017-07-05 01:32:20	Daftpunk	pepee, I tried python and loved every minute of it. But apparently bash is like the must on linux so I switched to bash

2017-12-09 19:26:06	hexnewbie	Oh, Konsole defaults to xterm. That's for legacy reasons - terminfo for konsole didn't exist before, and you sometimes used to ssh into machines that don't have it

2018-02-11 12:08:08	clemens3	james_brown: what also helps is to use as many linux/unix tools on windows before the final switch.. e.g. use libreoffice instead of ms office, use bash.. etc. all the unix tools available on windows, use them early on, merge your work process, then finally you can easily move over completely if you like

I am at a remote location, VPN'ed into a network, on this remote network, there are two servers, serv1 and serv2. I can access serv1 directly but cannot access serv2, give me connection refused on port 22. But, I can access serv2 from serv1 perfectly fine.

2018-02-12 13:38:39	mhicklen	james_brown: bind mount is like mounting a directory into anoter place; a hard link points to a specific inode on the same filesystem, and a symbolic link is a link that can point across filesystems

2018-02-12 20:30:47	rascul	no_gravity my point is that if you're going to write some ncurses program to do weird stuff to accomplish what you want, seems easier to just modify the terminal emulator itself and skip all the crap

2018-02-13 01:25:09	Foxfir3__	ananke: I isntalled Fedora on the card. Didnt format it or anything. I was suprised that I could create a new partition on the card after running the install with dd. what i did was, after checking the install, i ran gparted on my laptop to expand the xfs partition. To my surprise I couldnt create a new partition in the unallocated space, becase there are 4 main partitions. Now I wonder what the 25mb
2018-02-13 01:25:15	Foxfir3__	fat partition is doint there, cause its not the boot partition.

2018-02-13 21:29:43	TJ-	VeryStableGenius: actually, EFI can be much easier to restore. It supports a 'simple boot path' intended for removable media that won't have a firmware menu entry - you simply put the EFI boot loader ( e.g: grubx64.efi) as "/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI" and then at boot-time use the firmware's manual boot menu to boot the disk in EFI mode, rather than selecting an OS entry.

2018-02-14 12:50:16	yankovic	Hello. Try to understand how to reduce the amount of tty(Alt+Ctrl+F[1-6]). Google said that 1)I should change the parameter ACTIVE_CONSOLES="/dev/tty[1-6]" in /etc/default/console-setup, 2)also remove the unused tty*.conf files in /etc/init/, and 3)change the value of NAutoVTs=6 in /etc/systemd/logind.conf. But my experiments show me that only point 2 have effect. But 1 and 3 doesn't affect anything at all. What the purpose of parameters in 1 and 3?

To issue a sanitize ooperation I jsust run the SANTIZIE comamnd. So I run BLOCK ERASE as defined in the specs. And then if I perform a STATUS EXT then I should poll for the progress. But currently polling for the progress doesn't give me anything - it's just the same register values that went in for the command.

2018-02-14 17:07:28	solidfox	left mouse button is usually primary, right is secondary. typically referred to as left-click and right-click
2018-02-14 17:07:44	solidfox	copy is CTRL+C and passt is CTRL+V
2018-02-14 17:07:51	Sitri	There isn't a key assigned to each, applications will use one of the three buffers.  Primary is what GTK and Qt applications will use.  Secondary AFAIK is only used by xclip and xsel (or other such things).  The third buffer is the selection buffer

2018-08-16 13:27:09	rascul	sud0x3 there are lots of advantages to running your own dns resolver, caching is certainly one of them, but there's are easier solutions if all you want is the cache (see nscd)
2018-08-16 13:27:32	djph	bloony: need to set up NAT Hairpin on the router then.  If you can't do that (or you're under double-nat), then local DNS is likely going to be best.

2018-08-16 13:28:57	rascul	being able to trivially insert/update/remove dns records for local development is also quite useful, in addition to avoiding isp or other dns resolvers which do bad things hijacking nxdomain or censoring domains

2018-08-16 13:31:26	hans_henrik	sud0x3: tbh i'd just trust the OS dns cache to do it's job tho, so the speedup would be negligible imo

2018-08-16 16:32:11	jim	ZeroWalker, the problem with binary packages that are in aptable archives, is they will introduce data structures to your database of installed packages (called "dependency trees"), and if those dependency trees are not compatible, it's this that can lead to dependency hell

2018-08-16 18:33:35	evanesoteric	I have a Docker question if I may impose... Say I have 2 websites using Nginx. Would each Docker container have Nginx installed, or would they each have an nginx-vhost which interfaces with Nginx installed on the server itself? Seems Docker would be a better fit to separate dynamic websites....?

When overwriting is enabled, BleachBit wipes the data with a single pass of blank data. At the end of a file, it may write additional data to wipe the slack space. To hide the original name, BleachBit renames the file to a long name and then a short name. Finally, the file is deleted.

It seems that if in my test.sh file I want to redirect the 'stdoutput' to a file script-wise, i.e. for the whole script, not just one command in it, I need to do `exec 1>some_file`;right?

2018-08-16 20:28:44	koala_man	I mean, 'exec foo > file' would also do that, but it would end up execve'ing after. In this case, the actual exec is skipped so the redirections apply to the current executable
