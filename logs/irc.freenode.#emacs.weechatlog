I'm working with mu4e contexts and when I attempt to refile or move a message it's directing it to an incorrect Maildir. Instead of /gmail/sent it's going to /gmail/gmail/sent. It's clearly a misconfiguration, but I'll be damned if I can find it.

When the process ends, the result (a file name) is inserted at the end of the current buffer. The function `fzf/after-term-handle-exit` tries to pick out that name, but it doesn't work. It seems rather silly to have the "term" output just inserted at the end of the buffer. Can't I get it some

2017-05-04 08:50:05	josteink	for a terminal editor, most distros ship vi, but not emacs by default
2017-05-04 08:50:18	josteink	People need to take an active interest in order to become Emacs-users
2017-05-04 08:50:48	josteink	And I guess you can argue whether that is a good thing or not... Someone not particularly interested is probably not going to use Emacs like it's meant to be used
2017-05-04 08:50:50	josteink	etc
2017-05-04 08:51:08	josteink	So maybe self-filtering is good? (At least as long as we're able to maintain a critical user-base)
2017-05-04 08:51:24	phillord	one problem with Emacs is that we don't switch enough on my default

2017-05-04 08:51:52	phillord	I've seen new python programmers using sublime because "it does auto-completion"
2017-05-04 08:51:58	phillord	yes, by
2017-05-04 08:52:17	josteink	Indeed. Barebones Emacs may have been "good enough" a decade ago
2017-05-04 08:52:32	josteink	But people expect a more polished and ready-to-use out-of-the-box experience these days
2017-05-04 08:52:39	 *	mekeor nods
2017-05-04 08:52:58	phillord	Just so. I mean, Emacs when I started using it, syntax highlighting wasn't on by default
2017-05-04 08:53:03	josteink	Maybe someone should make an Emacs-fork... with a funky name or something... like ZEmacs!
2017-05-04 08:53:42	phillord	or, we could just switch stuff on in the existing Emacs....
2017-05-04 08:53:47	josteink	mhm
2017-05-04 08:54:08	josteink	The problem with deeply involved core-developers is that they problably dont see or have this problem

2017-05-04 08:54:45	josteink	My biggest WTF as for missing defaults was why select-s-expression by default doesnt select whole XML elements in nxml-mode... unless you customize it

2017-05-04 08:55:49	phillord	I mean, you have already installed spaceemacs and had to know that it exists

2017-05-04 08:56:26	phillord	josteink: yes, of course, this is true. but having a few more people adding to core worried about the new user experience would be a good thing.
2017-05-04 08:56:28	josteink	thats OOB for me
2017-05-04 08:56:41	mekeor	is it a good idea to make emacs work OOTB for major programming languages, including auto-completion?
2017-05-04 08:56:43	phillord	josteink: yes, exactly
2017-05-04 08:56:50	josteink	by that standard I think Spacemacs has a better OOB setup than emacs, no?
2017-05-04 08:57:17	phillord	mekeor: company-mode on for programming modes, yes, I think that would be good

2017-05-04 08:58:01	josteink	phillord: I think another one of the bigger non-code issues Emacs has right now is the friction between MELPA and ELPA/Emacs core

2017-05-04 08:58:48	josteink	which are thriving because they are developed and deployed independently, with much less hastle than a core Emacs release

2017-05-04 08:59:52	josteink	oh ok
2017-05-04 09:00:17	josteink	so core has "blessed" company. did it do so at the cost of auto-complete?
2017-05-04 09:00:24	phillord	I want it to be in the standard tarball/windows binaries also.
2017-05-04 09:00:44	phillord	josteink: yes, it did so effectively. I don't know why.
2017-05-04 09:01:09	josteink	iirc company-mode can use auto-complete mode providers, but not the other way around
2017-05-04 09:01:18	josteink	so company-mode probably offers the widest range of auto-completion support
2017-05-04 09:01:22	 *	phillord nods
2017-05-04 09:01:27	josteink	that would at least make a good argument, as far as I can see

2017-05-04 09:16:19	phillord	josteink: no, you misunderstand me. RMS wants to encourage people to write Emacs code  which is covered by copyright assignment, that the FSF can protect it. 
2017-05-04 09:16:33	rmrfroot	drduck```: if you are using helm you can instead use `helm-projectile-find-file` in https://github.com/bbatsov/helm-projectile
2017-05-04 09:17:17	phillord	so the GNU distrubution of Emacs contains only FSF assigned code (or public domain).

2017-05-04 09:19:56	josteink	LSP made it a -breeze to implement IDE-like functionality in Emacs

2017-05-04 09:20:35	phillord	josteink: any idea how well it compares to stuff like nrepl or swank?
2017-05-04 09:20:41	angrybacon	drduck``` You can run emacs as a server and attach client to it, that is when you want the 2 frames to share buffers for instance
2017-05-04 09:20:42	mekeor	drduck```: it's best to run two emacsclients with one emacs-server/emacs-daemon

2017-05-04 09:21:22	mekeor	drduck```: try it out with `M-x server-start` and then just run `emacsclient -c`
2017-05-04 09:21:34	krux02	But I think using one big monitor is better and then virtual desktops
2017-05-04 09:21:43	angrybacon	drduck``` Replace whatever you used to start up Emacs by emacsclient
2017-05-04 09:21:50	krux02	then I don't need to turn my head and have less energy consumption
2017-05-04 09:22:12	rski	josteink: did you use it inside emacs?
2017-05-04 09:22:14	krux02	but yes emacsclient is probably what you are looking for
2017-05-04 09:22:20	josteink	phillord: LSP is basically a proposition for a standard protocol regardless of language. Its meant ot be either a stdin/stdout interaction OR a network daemon
2017-05-04 09:22:24	drduck```	Ahh ok great

2017-05-04 09:22:57	phillord	nrepl is pretty much the same thing, with some semantics for tracking sessions and the like
2017-05-04 09:23:19	phillord	for me, I like the idea, if it solves the n^2 problem (n langauges, m editors)
2017-05-04 09:23:20	josteink	phillord: I havent looked into how swank/nrepl is implemented, but in my experience, Ive gotten decent auto-completion at least
2017-05-04 09:23:38	josteink	phillord: what I like about LSP is that the language server is often implemented by the same people  making the compiler, making the support first class
2017-05-04 09:23:48	josteink	phillord: (and often based on the same analysis as the compiler)
2017-05-04 09:24:04	 *	phillord nods
2017-05-04 09:24:13	josteink	phillord: IF they do that, they can also semi-trivially implement more sophisticated features such as automated module imports, safe refactoring , etc
2017-05-04 09:24:24	phillord	that is very attractive.
2017-05-04 09:24:28	josteink	(and implementing that in a language agnostic LSP-client just dead simple)
2017-05-04 09:25:00	josteink	let me show you my changeset to get tide (a "LSP client" for typescript) to support automatic imports and stuff like that
2017-05-04 09:25:32	drduck```	Those of you who need to use Javascript on a regular basis, do you use any packages for eslint? I saw that there was one such package but the link for support for emacs is now broken https://github.com/angelozerr/tern-lint

2017-10-08 00:49:40	VG234	Is emacs calc sufficient for use with set theory? It has several set operations but it can't find the cardinality of a set which contains a set. Is it the right tool to use for set theory?

2017-10-08 01:59:46	wkmanire	I need Emacs you a question.
2017-10-08 02:03:25	wkmanire	When defining a generic mode, is it possible to specify a 3 character comment starter?
2017-10-08 02:04:20	wkmanire	Seems like it can only be either 1 or 2 characters. This doesn't work for basics that use "REM" to start a comment line.
2017-10-08 02:05:52	forcer	wkmanire: Yeah, I think Emacs' syntax commands only support two-character comment starters. I'd check with some existing BASIC mode to see how they do it - might be they don't even do comment syntax at all, just fontification...
2017-10-08 02:07:16	wkmanire	forcer: Honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing. I've always wanted to write a major mode for a language. I'm experimenting with qbasic.
2017-10-08 02:07:37	wkmanire	It seems like you can get pretty far with define-generic-mode, but I think I'm going to need to derive from prog-mode to do this properly.

2017-10-08 02:09:37	forcer	wkmanire: "Deriving" just means re-using some parts of - if stuff does not work, read the source of prog-mode to see what they do that you might need to do as well. Also, looking at existing basic modes will help you come up with ideas on how to solve things, or even give you ideas for new features. Just make sure to never copy stuff without understanding it.
2017-10-08 02:09:51	wkmanire	I want to do all of those neat things that more advanced major modes do. Like recognize functions, variables, language keywords, automatic indentation, etc...

2017-10-08 03:50:11	wasamasa	njsg: no, it's about relying on internals that changed in a later version
2017-10-08 03:50:23	codingquark	wasamasa: I understand that most people won't be able to read the code. So it should be avoided. But, I can teach programming to my father probably, if I use Gujarati! Nobody else is going to read it anyway. And it can be great fun for students.
2017-10-08 03:50:30	wkmanire	If the coder can provide this support without making the code more complex then sure, but the maintenance burden isn't worth it. Especially considering that the vast majority of it is volunteer work.
2017-10-08 03:50:33	njsg	Sometimes, people are doing intensive work or don't have time to handle an upgrade. And it requires handling.

2017-10-08 03:53:24	njsg	The extra part is: they will never disclose these patches, they are eager to end support, of course, because it'd be bad for business otherwise. But people do use older versions for a multitude of reasons.

2017-10-08 03:58:23	ealfonso	yeah, it doesn't work with a symbol like python-mode-map which is not a feature.

2017-10-08 04:00:36	njsg	I suppose a good rule would also be not rewriting things for the sole purpose of dropping support for older versions. As far as you don't do it "aggressively", maybe you're on the right side of the force?

2017-10-08 04:01:11	wkmanire	On one hand you think you're doing the community a favor by not refactoring code to simplify it after dropping support for an older version
2017-10-08 04:01:20	njsg	It's a trade-off, for sure, there are two clear extremes, I suppose the first thing to avoid is sticking to either of the extremes.
2017-10-08 04:01:21	ealfonso	my issue is that I know which mode map symbol I want, but not always the mode that provides it
2017-10-08 04:01:26	wkmanire	On the other hand, you're kicking the can down the road to the next person who needs to read and understand the package to be able to contribute.

2017-10-08 04:05:33	ealfonso	for example, I know I want c-mode-map. but if I guessed that the mode providing it is "c-mode" I'd be wrong. it is "cc-mode-map"

2017-10-08 04:06:17	wasamasa	ealfonso: I just look up the definition of the thing, jump to the bottom, look at the provided feature and use that for `with-eval-after-load'

2017-10-08 04:07:29	wasamasa	why programmatically?
2017-10-08 04:07:45	forcer	ealfonso: It might come as a surprise, but before the file that defines a symbol is loaded, the symbol is not defined :-D
2017-10-08 04:08:15	forcer	You could hook into `after-load-functions' and check with `boundp' and `fboundp'. But that seems like a bad solution.

2017-10-08 04:11:35	fsbot	My sources say no!

2017-10-08 08:36:54	dxtr	So in my .dir-locals.el I am setting tags-table-list to "TAGS" - I guess that doesn't do what I want?
2017-10-08 08:36:58	dxtr	I want the TAGS file to be in my project root
2017-10-08 08:37:01	dxtr	not in each sub directory

2017-10-08 08:39:17	defanor	are you setting that list to a list, or just to that "TAGS" string?

2017-10-08 08:40:29	dxtr	Oh yeah, but it seems like just putting '("TAGS") in that setting makes emacs think it is "TAGS" in each directory - am I correct in my assessment?

But this means the text runs off through the right margin, *and* I am not able to use C-e to read the rest (it shows a $ at the last column, C-e just moves the cursor to the $ and doesn't show the rest.

2017-10-08 14:28:02	wasamasa	none of the things you mentioned have anything to do with projects

2017-10-08 14:28:44	wasamasa	so switching to one of these will load up that file instead
2017-10-08 14:30:21	Doow	I don't know what projects means in a emacs-specific context. I just mean some way to group settings (such as search path) depending on if I work with say a ruby script deploying to our build system or a c++ program doing something completely different, or an unrelated, second c++ program.

2017-10-09 00:18:49	twb	aidalgol: they were quite big compared to hobbyist gear --- too big for a single person to lift
2017-10-09 00:18:51	aidalgol	tamouse__: So my question still remains unanswered: why did we start calling hobbyist aircraft "drones"?
2017-10-09 00:18:52	njsg	technology is so advanced that they're bound to resemble RC aircraft, and RC aircraft will be upgaded to the point they resemble war drones

2017-10-09 02:29:47	laertus	quote keeps what would otherwise be a lisp expression from being evaluated
2017-10-09 02:30:01	laertus	and it can be written (quote foo) or 'foo
2017-10-09 02:30:04	laertus	which are equivalent
2017-10-09 02:30:23	wasamasa	yes, but what does `read' produce?
2017-10-09 02:30:31	laertus	a lisp object
2017-10-09 02:30:35	wasamasa	...
2017-10-09 02:30:40	laertus	an expression?
2017-10-09 02:30:41	wasamasa	with regards to a quoted object of course
2017-10-09 02:31:19	laertus	tell me
2017-10-09 02:31:26	laertus	i give up
2017-10-09 02:31:40	wasamasa	it produces (quote foo), no matter whether the sources say 'foo or (quote foo)
2017-10-09 02:31:56	wasamasa	the quote character is expanded to (quote ...) and is said to be a reader macro
2017-10-09 02:32:28	wasamasa	so, if emacs ever complains about 'foo, it will never say 'foo, but rather (quote foo) because that's what has been read
2017-10-09 02:33:09	laertus	ok, but why does (type-of 'foo) say it's a symbol, while (type-of my-variable) say its a cons?
2017-10-09 02:33:13	wasamasa	(quote foo) is a list of the quote symbol and the foo symbol, so naturally its type is cons

2017-10-09 02:34:11	wasamasa	if you try to evaluate that list, the evaluator dispatches on the car of the list and as that happens to be the symbol quote, it returns the second list item as is, without evaluating it
2017-10-09 02:35:18	laertus	ok, this is why i couldn't give that good an explanation of this:  because i haven't learned about evaluators or how interpreters work

2017-10-09 02:39:37	wasamasa	probably because in some situations (like when writing macros) you'll want exactly that

2017-10-09 04:34:41	parsnip	i don't think lambda calculus and general functional programming has much to do with category theory. but the way Haskell decided to solve a design issue (IO, etc), i think touches in category theory. it's not fresh in my mind where they touch.

2017-10-09 05:04:28	laertus	with lisp i just find it much easier to be polylingual like that... it's so easy to understand, even if you've been away for a while

2017-10-09 05:05:21	laertus	also, i've found stylistically the statically typed language crowd loves their one-letter variable names
2017-10-09 05:05:39	parsnip	for one, i probably could have written it better anyways, and two, being terser, and having referential transparency, and static type-checking, might be a lot easier to come back and start working on.

2017-12-06 21:59:54	it3ration	it's not actually changing paredit-mode-map though is it
2017-12-06 21:59:56	girzel	it depends on when the hooks run
2017-12-06 21:59:58	girzel	no
2017-12-06 22:00:14	girzel	but if you can get it to run last, it will work correctly
2017-12-06 22:00:15	it3ration	yeah, i bet paredit's hook runs after that which would probably screw it up no
2017-12-06 22:00:24	girzel	yup
2017-12-06 22:00:34	it3ration	there's probably a better way haha
2017-12-06 22:00:46	girzel	so put it in paredit-mode-hook instead

2017-12-06 22:55:41	Profpatsch	I want to find out what hooks are called and stuff. 
2017-12-06 22:56:10	Profpatsch	Concretely, the indentation is b0rked for nix-mode, and hitting Enter calls newline-and-indent.
2017-12-06 22:56:15	wasamasa	the elisp manual
2017-12-06 22:56:40	Profpatsch	I’m pointed to indent-according-to-mode in indent.el
2017-12-06 22:57:02	Profpatsch	And the indent-line-function is set to indent-relative.
2017-12-06 22:57:04	wasamasa	you'll find that most of the time you don't need to know everything that happens when hitting a key and in the few cases where it matters, you'll just look up all the things happening in the command loop and inspect one after the other
2017-12-06 22:57:43	Profpatsch	Ah, were can I see the command loop?
2017-12-06 22:57:52	wasamasa	still the elisp manual
2017-12-06 22:58:11	Profpatsch	Because indent-relative shouldn’t to any reindenting if I see correctly, just realign the curser to the last indentation
2017-12-06 22:58:28	Profpatsch	So some hook or similar is called somewhere.

2017-12-07 14:24:12	forcer	mrvirtuoso: Symbols in lisp are a concept that does not have a direct equivalence in other languages. In Emacs Lisp, a symbol is a special type of object with a few fields that also happens to be used by the language itself for the its implementation.
2017-12-07 14:24:35	forcer	Pymacs is not an answer to the question, and more than moribund.

2017-12-07 14:26:42	forcer	fledermaus: What emacs lisp does with symbols is a mix of interned strings and the globals() dict in Python. Variables are not first-class entities, so that aspect does not map well at all.

2017-12-11 10:24:40	thepreacher	For the umpteenth time I'm trying to put together my own emacs config after trying most of the popular starter kits. I have basic elisp knowledge and have for the first time put together a config that I mostly understand. However I've struggled with a problem for days now and I'm now willing to pay for help is someone is willing to take a look at my init.el.

2017-12-13 10:40:32	rememberYou	d125q: I've got the same "20171210.2136", seem so that I've got the last one too. I just don't understand why Emacs can't figure out `:custom`, maybe I did a mistake. Thank you for your help, `use-package` always nice for a clean config.

2017-12-13 12:51:24	__heisenbug	I am running into a very interesting problem. So I am running emacs 27.0.50 and want to use php-mode. I had the old package as it didn't run anymore on the newer emacs. With the new package of php-mode it runs. But _ONLY_ if I start emacs out of a usual terminal (But I start emacs in GUI mode). If I start emacs with DWM, thus SUPER+P and run php-mode in a PHP file emacs crashes. Any ideas on this? Why would it behave like that? As fa
2017-12-13 12:51:24	__heisenbug	as I know the same binary should be run in both scenarios...
2017-12-13 12:52:21	__heisenbug	Ah and it only crashes for php-mode
2017-12-13 12:53:17	Hi-Angel	__heisenbug: one thing I can tell you — it's definitely a bug that needs to be reported. Even if there're errors, Emacs shouldn't be crashing.
2017-12-13 12:53:37	Hi-Angel	__heisenbug: however, did you try removing all the *elc files of the php mode, and rebuilding it?

2017-12-13 13:02:58	__heisenbug	So I went for several different tries. First of all I deleted all *.elc files. On the first run I did everything like before and it opened the PHP file. On the second run it didn't anymore. Then I checked if the *.elc files are recreated, they were not. So I tried some more times but they all failed. After that I opened the file with C-x f instead of dired. Interestingly it doesn't crash that way. WTF?

2017-12-13 13:05:43	Hi-Angel	__heisenbug: you might want to report a bug. But you'd need to pin down the actual issue, so e.g. run emacs -Q, and then load only specific files from php-mode and maybe dired, and see if it crashes…

2017-12-13 14:47:25	aamirm	Hi again. Whenever I modify a file in emacs it creates ".#filename.ext" in the folder. Is there a way to disable this? I've set backup and autosave to nil but its still creating the file.
2017-12-13 14:47:42	paluche	that's a lock file.
2017-12-13 14:49:22	defanor	aamirm: you may want to set `backup-directory-alist' instead of disabling backups completely, btw. it may save some data someday

2017-12-18 14:01:45	fsbot	frame-list is a built-in function in `C source code'.

2017-12-18 14:02:40	JordiGH	Huh, TIL that when hotels tell you to reuse towels, it's of no benefit to the environment like they claim. It merely reduces the hotel's costs.
2017-12-18 14:02:48	yiimi	maybe i needed to eval-expression
2017-12-18 14:02:54	paluche	yiimi: it's a function, not a command. M-x only lets you run commands.
2017-12-18 14:02:56	fledermaus	it's not a command 
2017-12-18 14:02:56	lemonpie	its not an interactive function, try eval'ing it with M-:

2017-12-18 15:47:14	JordiGH	Uhm, I think it's pretty easy.
2017-12-18 15:47:28	JordiGH	If they show up on the federated feed, you click on their name and that has a "+" button to follow them.
2017-12-18 15:47:56	JordiGH	If you find them through their own instance, you click on + and that takes you to a remote follow page that asks you what username and instance you want to follow them from.

2018-01-06 10:04:39	parsnip	jil: i can't recommend spacemacs. i think the number of people that have good feelings about spacemacs i could count on one or two hands.
2018-01-06 10:04:45	stardiviner	And here is my code: https://gist.github.com/stardiviner/183cf55d747fc6b1420fe8d0f693f6d4 
2018-01-06 10:05:19	parsnip	it usually creates friction when trying to help people, sometimes ending up wasting a lot of time if they omit to say they're using spacemacs.
2018-01-06 10:05:20	junnu	spacemacs is basically emacs with some configurations to give features mentioned here https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs

2018-01-06 10:05:35	fsbot	I think spacemacs is support is available at https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs .. + other notes
2018-01-06 10:05:42	parsnip	widp: write more
2018-01-06 10:05:47	widp	not code though.
2018-01-06 10:05:58	widp	I am using google docs and can't seem to switch for some reason.
2018-01-06 10:05:59	parsnip	not code
2018-01-06 10:06:19	parsnip	maybe google docs is better for you
2018-01-06 10:06:20	widp	are there anything packages/setups that make it more convenient ?
2018-01-06 10:06:41	jil	are you writting in latex ?
2018-01-06 10:06:46	widp	I am 70% sure it is because I am in a browser most of the time.
2018-01-06 10:06:57	widp	jil: I usually put stuff into latex later.
2018-01-06 10:06:59	parsnip	that's fine
2018-01-06 10:07:38	widp	There must be something I am missing out on for not using emacs for this.
2018-01-06 10:07:39	jil	it auctex mode that made me take emacs by the horns.  
2018-01-06 10:07:57	mgsk	stardiviner: you're passing two arguments (comment-dwim nil) and (insert " ") to the lambda which takes a single optional argument args.
2018-01-06 10:08:08	jil	auctex and org mode.  for me they make life easier writing in emacs than google.
2018-01-06 10:08:09	widp	doesn't latex commands *block* what you are trying to write?
2018-01-06 10:08:22	junnu	@widp you could try org mode in emacs
2018-01-06 10:08:25	widp	I am.
2018-01-06 10:08:33	stardiviner	mgsk: I see, Thanks. 
2018-01-06 10:08:36	jil	you can write in org mode for example and export to latex
2018-01-06 10:09:01	jil	or use shortcut to insert latex commande easly directly in your latex code
2018-01-06 10:09:12	widp	If it's not outline stuff why use org-mode?

2018-01-06 10:11:17	mgsk	stardiviner: try doing (lambda (&rest args) ...) instead.
2018-01-06 10:11:35	widp	are there packages geared towards making emacs good for prose, I've heard of apps which do this (Scrivener, I think)
2018-01-06 10:12:15	parsnip	what's wrong with text-mode
2018-01-06 10:12:29	parsnip	fill-column, etc
2018-01-06 10:12:39	mgsk	stardiviner: or maybe you need to mark your org-babel-ref-prepend-comment-char as (interactive).
2018-01-06 10:13:04	widp	parsnip: I think it might just be the theme I am using.
2018-01-06 10:13:05	n2o4	I do most of my writing in Org-mode as well.  It gives me all the options of exporting, tracking time, scheduling and what not.

2018-01-06 10:14:17	stardiviner	mgsk: Thanks 
2018-01-06 10:14:30	widp	parsnip doesn't having commands interspersed with text not cause issues for you?
2018-01-06 10:14:51	widp	n2o4: Maybe there are loads of features of org-mode I haven't yet incorporated into my work flow.
2018-01-06 10:15:08	widp	Slowly learning them might make it suitable for me.
2018-01-06 10:15:10	mgsk	stardiviner: well done :)
2018-01-06 10:15:23	parsnip	widp: the commands are much easier than in a word processor where i have to figure out how to move the address to top left, etc.

2018-01-06 10:16:11	parsnip	latex is pretty nice.
2018-01-06 10:16:24	widp	I see. I'll try moving away from word processors then.
2018-01-06 10:16:32	parsnip	but it can be a time suck, so if google docs is working for you, stick with that.
2018-01-06 10:16:42	widp	yeah, I should consider that.
2018-01-06 10:16:48	widp	thanks guys.
2018-01-06 10:17:10	n2o4	"Use what works for you" is a pretty good rule to go by :)
2018-01-06 10:17:20	parsnip	yeah, it's not the interspersing of the commands that bugs me, it's the time suck. but the fact i only need to save text is a plus.
2018-01-06 10:17:40	parsnip	pros and cons.
2018-01-06 10:18:07	widp	not having org within text makes it hard for me to revise and take notes on how to improve it, so there's that.
2018-01-06 10:18:33	widp	I could maintain a separate org file, but that's not really handy.
2018-01-06 10:18:45	parsnip	huh?

2018-01-06 10:19:22	@forcer	(I moved away from latex a whole long while back, but I fully understand why people use it)
2018-01-06 10:19:39	widp	So I have a small list at the end of the file. There I take notes of what I could do to make it better.
2018-01-06 10:20:46	@forcer	Yeah, Emacs could do with some mode for annotations similar to the google docs / word annotation thing. Which I think is mostly a display problem, really.
2018-01-06 10:20:47	widp	that's not really that convenient in a word processor.
2018-01-06 10:21:05	@forcer	widp: Huh? Add notes to your documents. It's awesome.
2018-01-06 10:21:31	parsnip	in Word i use sectioning and open the navigation pane on the left.
2018-01-06 10:21:33	widp	I meant having something like that in emacs with org-mode goodies vs google docs.
2018-01-06 10:21:42	parsnip	that makes Word feel a little like org-mode
2018-01-06 10:21:49	widp	I never look at the annotations :D.
2018-01-06 10:22:12	@forcer	Well, a feature you don't use indeed is not very helpful :-D

2018-01-06 10:42:42	hmw	razzy: Yes, could be. On the other hand, I use the same shoes in summer and winter time. So on average, the see summer and winter equally over ten years.

2018-01-06 15:05:04	ealfonso	 my compilation-ask-about-save and compilation-save-buffers-predicate are both nil, yet compile still refuses to proceed because some random buffers that have nothing to do with current buffer haven't been saved...

2018-01-06 15:07:31	wasamasa	that's known as statistical profiling BTW
2018-01-06 15:07:42	wasamasa	there's also a tracing profiler, but it sucks
2018-01-06 15:08:12	sg2002	ealfonso: What compile command are you using? I know that byte-recompile-directory calls save-some-buffers, what else?

2018-01-06 15:08:41	macrover	yes, that tracing profiler was so bad, now I remember why I ignore it
2018-01-06 15:09:07	macrover	but statistical profiler is gold
2018-01-06 15:09:12	wasamasa	well, not really
2018-01-06 15:09:14	sg2002	macrover: There's also trace-function which is somewhat similar but is more for debugging.
2018-01-06 15:09:25	wasamasa	it just guesses how the call tree looks like and sometimes gets it completely wrong
2018-01-06 15:09:44	wasamasa	having to report *before* stopping is annoying, but there's no obvious way to fix it
2018-01-06 15:10:04	wasamasa	finally, truncation of the call tree is a major pain in the ass, you have to expand it all and copy the whole buffer into another buffer
2018-01-06 15:10:09	ealfonso	sg2002 I fixed it via:  (setf compilation-save-buffers-predicate (lambda () nil))

2018-01-06 17:43:14	krwq	narendraj9: locale and encoding are slightly separate concepts
2018-01-06 17:43:42	krwq	so encoding (utf-8, utf-16) tells you how to convert number to bytes (number <==> unicode codepoint)
2018-01-06 17:43:59	krwq	locale tells you how specific country compares characters
2018-01-06 17:44:07	krwq	or how to capitalize them

2018-01-06 17:44:30	krwq	i.e. if I use Polish ą and capitalize it with english culture I'll likely get the same character
2018-01-06 17:44:43	krwq	i.e. for some countries like germany
2018-01-06 17:44:53	krwq	that weird german B might be the same as ss
2018-01-06 17:45:10	krwq	but for english locale it won't be the same
2018-01-06 17:45:52	krwq	or if you case insensitive compare Polish ą with Ą on English you will likely get that they are not the same character while in pl-PL you will get that they are
2018-01-06 17:46:08	narendraj9	krwq: So, does string comparision take that into account? I thought we simply compare the code point values.
2018-01-06 17:46:11	krwq	or capitalizing letter 'I' in turkish is weird
2018-01-06 17:46:36	krwq	narendraj9: depends how editor implement it and what language they use - I'm not sure about emacs

2018-01-06 17:48:00	krwq	yes - if you have a web server you should either use invariant or ordidinal comparison
2018-01-06 17:48:15	krwq	ordinal looks at code points - either the same or not
2018-01-06 17:48:37	krwq	invariant don't know the details but will do right thing in most of the cases
2018-01-06 17:48:49	krwq	any other culture you might get surprises

2018-01-06 17:59:09	narendraj9	Or maybe it's not the same symbol. It's about different ways of getting to the same symbol.
2018-01-06 17:59:34	krwq	unicode has only one mapping from code point to a symbol but there might be duplicate symbols just in case country decides to change it
2018-01-06 17:59:49	krwq	encoding for the same code point might be different
2018-01-06 18:00:04	bpalmer	narendraj9: 'Precomposed characters are the legacy solution for representing many special letters in various character sets.

As far as I can tell, two approaches would be to either use systemd or a cron job. But wouldn't it be pretty bad performance-wise to run this every couple of seconds? Ideally, I would like to receive emails
2018-01-06 21:14:51	conceivably	as close to instantly as possible. What solutions do people here use?

2018-01-06 21:42:37	clandest	thanks, CC Mode has different syntax formating. The default is the gnu formating, i wounder if other modes follow suit?

Conventionally, single semicolons are used for end-of-line comments, double semicolons are used for line comments (indented the same as code), and triple semicolons are used for block comments or sectioning (always at zero indentation).

2018-01-07 18:21:34	physikoi	Hi #emacs. I notice that when launching emacs in daemon mode, ie `emacs --daemon`, causes two emacs processes to spawn. One temporary one, which i guess is necessary to spawn the daemon. Question -- is that so? Does emacs daemon need a separate emacs process to "kickstart" it?

2018-01-07 18:23:45	physikoi	wasamasa: ok, ok. good to know. I ask because I'm working on bash script...well, sounds like this is a unix thing and not an emacs thing. thanks, that helps

2018-01-07 19:36:39	parsnip	sab110: you can use use-package or not, pros and cons. try both. not using use-package, helps to make sure you understand how emacs does things.

2018-02-08 19:35:18	dieggsy	rafaelbeirigo_: you could call all packages "hacks" internally. I say it's not since you want to define a number of things based on a set parsable structure and some changing inputs. it seems logical then to take each input (they just so happen to be comma delimited) and create the thing sbased on them

2018-02-20 18:29:46	hodapp	it's not readily clear to me why seeing how one computes 'total number of ratings of both item i and item j' should immediately bring to mind 'covariances'
2018-02-20 18:30:59	JordiGH	It's not literally covariances, just saying that covariances are the prototypical example of all pairwise dot products.
2018-02-20 18:31:43	JordiGH	Because a dot product, geometrically, is the product of the magnitudes of two vectors weighted by their angle.
2018-02-20 18:32:32	JordiGH	So if you have a bunch of vectors and you want to see how similar they are to each other, you take all of the pairwise dot products. Every vector times everything else. Or X'X in matrix notation.
2018-02-20 18:33:02	JordiGH	In this case, you're trying to see how similar raters are to each other, right?
2018-02-20 18:33:22	JordiGH	Well, you're doing it kind of negatively; you're trying to figure out how different raters are from each other.
2018-02-20 18:33:25	bremner	rudybot: raters gonna rate.
2018-02-20 18:33:26	rudybot	bremner: raters gonna rate
2018-02-20 18:33:52	JordiGH	So that's kind of why you end up doing M'M
2018-02-20 18:34:24	hodapp	it's never exactly doing similarity between raters in this algorithm, it's just answering "how many users rated both item i and item j"
2018-02-20 18:35:02	JordiGH	Right, but it so happens that answering this question is the same as figuring out how many ratings in common raters have.

The elpa repository (https://orgmode.org/elpa) sends a HTTP redirect to the same address leading to an HTTP redirect error. But this only occurs for Emacs, curl etc. work fine over the same proxy.

2018-02-21 10:16:18	defanor	well, for 1d one could collect all the min and max boundaries, put them on a line, and traverse, storing currently active ones in a hash table – that'd be about O(n), unless hash table would be awfully inefficient. i guess it can be extended for higher dimensions by traversing each dimension that way separately, and then getting intersection of the results alone

2018-02-21 15:10:40	dansa	quotemstr: yes, that's interesting.  it gives you some sort of local concentration, let's call it that.  coffee mostly acts as a substance to make you feel good, so if something was disturbing you from work, now it's gone, you can concentrate on work.  (but that's not really concentration.  it's more like a very local sense of pleasure.)

2018-02-21 15:14:46	hodapp	technomancy: uhh, it's pretty well-documented that caffeine can exacerbate anxiety and cause jitteriness, and that's not a "wider problem", it's a standard symptom for larger doses than normal for a person (which can still be fairly small doses)
2018-02-21 15:14:58	steckerhalter	dansa: and with beer it's not the alcohol, it works also with alcohol free beer

2018-02-21 18:05:56	taylskid	so I have this little major-mode https://gist.github.com/taylskid/a81ca9343711ada4ba85c7451803185a
2018-02-21 18:06:28	trevoke	Would by chance the bit that's not being highlighted the keyword "false" ?
2018-02-21 18:06:43	tromey	there's a typo in "false"
2018-02-21 18:07:10	taylskid	in font-lock-studio everything highlights correctly, but if I try to load the mode normally, the `pico8-find-data2` fucntion doesn't end up highlighting from `__gfx__` to the end of the buffer

2018-03-29 23:04:56	herr_jth	mh, as a last resort maybe. What confuses me is that even that simple identify via msg to NickServ doesn't work and I have no idea how to debug it, *messages* stays empty, the "server buffer" doesn't mention anything
2018-03-29 23:05:25	rocx	sorry. having a similar issue as well.
2018-03-29 23:05:36	rocx	it *used* to work but i can't figure out what i did to make it work.
2018-03-29 23:05:38	herr_jth	elfeed has this nice log buffer, but erc doesn't seem to have that :/
2018-03-29 23:06:51	herr_jth	yeah... actually I'am not even sure if my authinfo.gpg is setup correctly... I've put my password in "", but is also contains some special characters, don't know if thats causing trouble
2018-03-29 23:06:54	fschuindt	Folks, in my init.el I set-face-foreground 'dired-directory "dark magenta". It works fine. But when Emacs is starting, it errors out: Invalid face, dired-directory. If I open Dired Mode then reload init.el again it works 'cause now it knows the dired-directory face. But's kinda annoying to do this every time I start Emacs. Any tip? Thanks!

2018-04-01 23:01:16	offby1	I suspect you don't -- piping implies that emacsclient will read the filename from stdin, and I don't think it does that.
2018-04-01 23:01:40	offby1	this might work though:  echo some/file/name | xargs emacsclient

2018-04-01 23:07:33	widp	annotating and for me the note taking feature is awesome.
2018-04-01 23:08:07	widp	in the menu I see 'Pipe', which I think means unix pipe.
2018-04-01 23:08:24	widp	my file associations are not right, so it opens pdfs in gimp, of all programs.

2018-04-01 23:13:04	average	widp: well, just xpdf
2018-04-01 23:13:07	offby1	widp: I'm very skeptical about "xargs doesn't work with piping"; that's it's whole purpose in life.  In any case, I just typed "echo some/file/name | xargs emacsclient" and it did exactly what I expected -- namely, my running emacs tried to open a file named "some/file/name"
2018-04-01 23:13:08	parsnip	doesn't mutt use files anyways?
2018-04-01 23:13:09	YoungFrog	I guess mutt pipes the content of the file, not a filename. If you want to handle it from emacs, it's best to save it as a file anyway ;  you should ask mutt to save it, and open the resluting file within emacs.
2018-04-01 23:13:28	offby1	YoungFrog: now _that_ makes sense

2018-04-02 01:25:43	DaPinkOne	"indentation of the table is sset by the first line" https://orgmode.org/guide/Tables.html makes it sound easy. is it not so?
2018-04-02 01:25:58	Twist	it's sitting under my headline, but needs to be under an unordered plain list item

2018-04-02 01:32:49	Twist	That solves my immediate column move problem too.. this thing's pretty forgiving about manually moving the pipes around then bashing tab.

2018-04-02 02:13:43	ldlework	Twist [ Control ][   Spacebar  ][ Mod ]
2018-04-02 02:13:53	ldlework	use your left thumb for control, right thumb for mod
2018-04-02 02:16:59	annadane	you people need to play more video games
2018-04-02 02:17:03	annadane	what is this brittle hand nonsense
2018-04-02 02:17:28	ldlework	Emacs keyboard bindings were established long before contemporary keyboard layout design.
2018-04-02 02:17:55	Twist	ldlework: that doesn't seem to alter the problem. it seems like the correct move is to use both hands to chord. ctrl or meta with the right if you need the left for the letters.
2018-04-02 02:18:17	Twist	annadane: games don't generally need ctrl WADS combinations.
2018-04-02 02:18:26	ldlework	It doesn't seem to alter the problem, really?
2018-04-02 02:18:36	ldlework	Compared to using pinky to push control, using your thumb, which doesn't require you to break proper typing posture, doesn't alter the problem?
2018-04-02 02:19:06	Twist	ldlework: yeah, the cramp is coming from odd contortions when I'm doing modifers with the left while also using letters with that hand
2018-04-02 02:19:26	ldlework	And nothing to do with the positioning of the control key itself. Well if you say so!
2018-04-02 02:19:57	ldlework	While, you don't have both modifiers on each hand with the above, there are typically additional keys in either direction that you can use for having both on each side if you absolutely demand that.
2018-04-02 02:19:58	Twist	ldlework: ctrl is a rough reach with either thumb from the home row
2018-04-02 02:20:10	Twist	oh
2018-04-02 02:20:24	Twist	I didn't follow your earlier suggestion of remapping the keys
2018-04-02 02:20:26	ldlework	You /move/ the key
2018-04-02 02:20:27	ldlework	to the left of spacebar.
2018-04-02 02:20:28	ldlework	its barely a curl...

2018-04-02 02:21:04	Twist	might work. I've got some deeply nested session comedy happening.
2018-04-02 02:21:11	ldlework	But there is an argument I have regarding using your left hand for control, and your right hand for mod, is that emacs has a base amount of functional duality with regard to modifier alternatives
2018-04-02 02:21:26	ldlework	Use your left thumb to do C-f, go forward a letter
2018-04-02 02:21:40	ldlework	Switch to your right thumb for M-f, to go forward a word, iow, faster
2018-04-02 02:22:08	Twist	meta-tab seems like a problem. windows really wants that keystroke.
2018-04-02 02:22:26	ldlework	A lot of the core text editing and navigation functions are amenable to this conceptualization
2018-04-02 02:22:27	ldlework	Right hand, left tab
2018-04-02 02:22:28	ldlework	just like you wanted right?
2018-04-02 02:22:29	ldlework	right hand mod, left hand tab
2018-04-02 02:24:29	Twist	seems reasonable.
